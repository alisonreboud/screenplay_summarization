surrenders', '#Greg has examined the gloves suspected to be the killer ’s', 'Because the cleaning woman was using ammonia , any evidence on the interior lining of the gloves , such as epithelial skin cells , was destroyed the moment the cleaning lady put the gloves on', 'However , they are able to “ print ” the gloves and determine that the palm print found on the murder weapon was indeed made by

bruising around ~Audrey ’s neck', '#Grissom also sees another set of marks around ~Audrey neck under the extension cord', 'This leads #Grissom to believe that ~Audrey was strangled first and then hung', 'In addition , #Grissom notes there are carpet fibers stuck to the heels of ~Audrey shoes , which indicates that ~Audrey was dragged across the floor', 'Upon further investigation , #Grissom

Kelly had met at their lawyer ’s office , #Catherine and #Grissom speculate that the two women discussed their respective problems and decided to help each other get rid of the causes – Gus Sugarman

Train , they believe Kelly and Audrey made a deal to kill the men that had sexually harassed the other', 'Since each of the men would be a stranger to his killer , it would be difficult to trace Kelly and Audrey to the murders – they would be committing the perfect crime as is theorized in the movie', \"~Audrey had never really intended to go through with the murders , but Kelly killed ~Gus and
