19-s04e10,catherine okay  boys catherine there s always room for jello nick oh  yeah bobby_dawson uh  catherine  technically  that s just gel catherine i was nt planning on eating it bobby_dawson okay  let s shoot it bobby_dawson betty crocker bobby_dawson firing one at 100   nick standard velocity is 1100 feet per second catherine all right  that is a  twelveinch penetration catherine so  a  um  hundred percent load gives us twelve inches bobby_dawson firing one at 70   catherine seven and threequarter inches bobby_dawson firing one at 40   nick 500 and  50 feet per second catherine four inches bobby_dawson same as ms mitchell catherine so mrs mitchell was shot by a bullet traveling 550 feet per second nick now that we know the speed  we can calculate the distance nick thanks  catherine,0
20-s04e10,bobby_dawson so standard velocity for a nine millimeter bullet is 1100 feet per second nick how far does a nine millimeter bullet have to travel before it slows down to 550 feet per second  bobby_dawson let s see bobby_dawson eighteen hundred feet bobby_dawson whoa bobby_dawson we re talking six football fields nick yeah  that would pretty much eliminate anyone that was in the mitchell s front yard nick can a nine millimeter bullet even travel that far  bobby_dawson hang on bobby_dawson all right bobby_dawson if a nine millimeter were fired straight  it d go about 600 feet before gravity brought it down  bobby_dawson but if a bullet were fired at an angle  could go a heck of a lot further nick that would account for the distance  but ms mitchell was shot at an eightyfivedegree angle nick that s basically perpendicular bobby_dawson um  bullets are predictable nick people  are nt marlene_mitchell no  stop it  nick i assumed she was standing nick okay  this is the mitchell s house nick  and by all eyewitness accounts  she was standing in front the house  facing away north  when she was shot  so this line represents the 1800 feet our bullet traveled nick it had to have come from somewhere  on that arc bobby_dawson good luck knocking on doors,1
