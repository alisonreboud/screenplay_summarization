7168,01:12:54:02,01:12:58:07,5308226531817199474.xml,1122,I challenged him.  He admitted it.  We argued and he left.

7175,01:13:20:15,01:13:26:01,5308226531817199474.xml,1129,I did it for you.

7228,01:16:28:13,01:16:34:07,5308226531817199474.xml,1182,Not likely to forget. 
7229,01:16:34:08,01:16:39:22,5308226531817199474.xml,1183,20 hours of labour.  You were exhausted.

That's the Premier League of  soup kitchens, apparently. Losing another night's  sleep, just like that? Well, you know, he can't  say no.  At least not to the needy and afflicted. Although I gotta tell you,  I've been feeling a bit needy and afflicted myself recently. Do you trust him?  How d'you mean? I'm marrying the man, aren't I?  What makes you say that? Just don't want to see you get hurt.  Oh, Patrick.  What's the matter?  I've done things in the past,  you know, things I'm ashamed of. And I...  I just don't know  how to put them right. Yolande?  Well, I'm sure Yolande  forgave you a long time ago."

I had another try.  Just a few minutes ago as a matter  of fact.  I sat her down, I talked to her about when she was a kid. Talked about the baby, the pregnancy.  And she crumpled?  Yeah. Just like last time?  It was like somebody had whipped  her legs out from underneath her. Then off she went.  She's got  loads of stuff to do for the wedding. She jumped in a taxi, said she needed  a few hours away from everybody. I've told you  how close she is to the edge. Do you really want me to  push her over? No. I've been acting like  a spoilt kid, haven't I? I want this, I want that.  I'm sorry.  Grandad, I really am.  When you're so  close to finally getting what... I haven't really been  very fair on you, have I? No, no, no you haven't.  I've been thinking about it all day.  What I've been putting you through  and I don't want you to do anything, not any more. I'm gonna  take responsibility instead. So whatever happens now,  it's all down to me. What are you talking about?  She's your daughter.  You want to  protect her, of course you do, how can I expect anything else? Don't you want to protect  your own mother? No-one knows how she's gonna react.  Of course they don't, that's the point.

What's that supposed to mean?  Like Sal said, forget about Janine. More important, what are we going  to do about that? Well, I bought my hat ages ago.  Well...I've got matching  earrings to go with mine."
