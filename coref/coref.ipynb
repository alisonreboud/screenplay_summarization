       "'Synopsis A grisly collision between a car and an eighteen-wheeler leads to a murder investigation at a furry convention. Meanwhile, a man is found dead in a freezer in an apparent robbery-homicide.  Plot Victims: Linda Jones (deceased), Robert Pitt (deceased)  On the case: Catherine Willows, Gil Grissom, Warrick Brown, Jim Brass  On a dimly lit stretch of road, Linda Jones is driving and looking for something. She suddenly collides with something, causing a loud thud. As she looks back to see what she hit, she swerves into oncoming traffic, and collides with an 18-wheeler truck. Later that night, while officers investigate the truck driver, Grissom and Catherine follow Linda\\'s tire tracks and see that she was braking for quite a while. They see a set of extremely large animal paw prints leading off the road, and find another victim: a man in a raccoon fursuit.  The next day, Grissom and Willows further investigate the \"raccoon\". Willows reveals that she once dated a Detroit Lions mascot, while David Phillips is reminded of a children\\'s show he once loved that starred a raccoon character. Grissom determines that the raccoon\\'s cause of death was blunt force trauma by motor vehicle, implying that he was the \"thud\" that Linda Jones hit before her death. They also find a piece of blue fur in the raccoon\\'s mouth.  The man in the raccoon suit revealed to be an Alcoholics Anonymous participant. While cutting the man out of his costume, a great deal of blood spills out, as it had nowhere else to escape; the forensics team finds a high-velocity bullet wound, thus adding to the man\\'s injuries.  In the lab, the blue fur found in the mouth is confirmed synthetic, and the raccoon is identified as Robert Pitt, who was court-ordered to join AA after being arrested for driving under the influence. A sample of Pitt\\'s digestive system reveals he had no alcohol in him, but rather ipecac (an emetic) and civet oil (an aphrodisiac).  Catherine and Brass search Robert\\'s residence, where they find a bedroom full of raccoon stuffed animals, as well as a calendar with October 29-November 1, 2003, marked as a \"PAF-Con\" meeting at the Kings River Hotel. She and Grissom go to this PAF-Con - the Plushies and Furries Convention - looking for a \"plushie\" conventiongoer in bright blue fur to match the sample in the costume\\'s mouth. Catherine is perplexed at the sight of the furries in the hotel lobby, while the fascinated Grissom looks at the situation philosophically and psychologically; the two continue this contrast throughout the episode. Grissom decides to attend a lecture.  At the convention, Grissom takes in the lecture, which centers on concepts of the difference between one\\'s form and one\\'s inner spirit or totem, and, during intermission, asks the person next to him if he recognizes Robert, which he doesn\\'t. Catherine has similar bad luck with a man in the lobby clutching a stuffed dog. Finally, both gain leads. After Grissom buys a picture of \"Rocky\" (Robert Pitt) with another furry from a photo vendor, he finds two girls in blue costumes; Willows sees a third blue cat walking down a catwalk during a fashion show. Although this cat - \"Sexy\" - shows some initial playful resistance, hissing at her, all five (the three furries and the two scientists) meet in the lobby.  \"Sexy\" is brought in for questioning, and he reveals his real name to be Bud Simmons. Grissom recognizes the scent of civet oil on Bud\\'s cat suit, and tells him that the costume may have had a part in Robert\\'s death. Simmons admits that he and \"Rocky\" did partake in \"skritching\" - in this context, quasi-sexual caressing - and his costume is taken in for analysis. Robert\\'s semen is found on the costume, as well as ipecac and civet oil.  In interrogation, Bud reluctantly admits that his actions that night led to a \"furpile\" and some \"yiffing\" - in short, an orgy - but denies that he was the one to apply the ipecac and civet oil to his fursuit. Catherine and Grissom make their way to a room at the convention where one such \"furpile\" is still going strong, and enter with a search warrant. Investigation of the fursuits of the participants reveals a wolf costume with ipecac and civet oil on its paws.  The suit\\'s owner, Mr. Lee, is brought in for questioning. Through a number of animal metaphors, Lee explains his actions, first admitting that he indeed applied the mixture to Bud\\'s \"Sexy\" costume. He reveals that \"Rocky\" couldn\\'t get enough of \"Sexy\", and that apparently \"Rocky\" was a very promiscuous individual, as he believes all raccoons (or raccoon characters) to be. In fact, Robert stole \"Linda Lamb\", Lee\\'s girlfriend and the woman who brought him into the furry fandom, from him at the previous year\\'s convention. Mr. Lee then reveals the lamb\\'s real name - the collision victim, Linda Jones. Catherine and Grissom check the trunk of Linda\\'s wrecked car and indeed see the Linda Lamb costume. They form a new conclusion about Robert\\'s death - that Linda, tired of Pitt\\'s philandering with other fursuiters, shot him and left him for dead.  After mulling over the known facts, they determine that Robert was on the side of the road because of a lover\\'s quarrel or \"car fight\" - because of the affair, either Linda kicked him out or he insisted on her letting him out of the car. The fact that Linda\\'s car was heading back toward the hotel suggests to Catherine that she was looking for Robert again to make up. Although the gunshot wound is still unexplained, she finds a valet ticket that might prove valuable.  At the hotel, the valet identifies Linda and Robert, noting that she was angry at Robert and that he was \"hammered.\" Flashbacks reveal the new hypothesis - Robert, still in costume, enters the car, sick from the ipecac. Linda believes he\\'s gone back on alcohol, and the combination of this and his attendance in the furpile makes her extremely angry. Later on, she is mad because Robert is still too delirious or stubborn to remove the mask, and he insists on being let out of the car to vomit. The gunshot still remains unexplained.  Back at the location of Robert\\'s death, Catherine and Grissom find the bullet, which struck from a very steep trajectory. They figure out that Robert was probably on all fours, and when they see a ranger truck driving along a cliff that would be the perfect location for the trajectory of the bullet, they consider the fact that he was not killed as a man but as an animal.  Catherine and Grissom identify the driver of the ranger truck, who, in recounting his night around the time of Linda\\'s vehicle collision, states that he saw a \"coyote\" - Robert - at the side of the road and shot it to protect his own dogs.  The episode ends with Catherine and Grissom incredulous at the full scope of Robert\\'s murder. A final flashback recounts the time after he left the car - doubled over in sickness, Robert is still throwing up when the ranger sees him and fires. Linda turns around to pick him up, and hits him as he crawls across the road. Catherine sums the incident up as a simple \"domestic dispute gone mad,\" while Grissom calls it \"Fur and Loathing in Las Vegas.\"  Victim: Al Sesto (deceased)  On the case: Nick Stokes, Sara Sidle, Sam Vega  At the Big & Best warehouse, a man, Al Sesto, is dead and frozen to the freezer floor. Nick and Sara determine the victim died trying to escape and was hit with a shotgun blast. In the next room, Det. Vega is investigating Petey, the night security guard at Big & Best. Caught in a lie about his whereabouts that night, he confesses to an extended time away from his post. While he was away, Al was murdered and six vending machines were broken into. He states that a man named George came by looking for Al before Petey left, and he ate his dinner when he returned. George\\'s car remains in the parking lot, and Det. Vega investigates.  At the warehouse, Doc Robbins helps remove Al from the freezer floor by pouring boiling water from around the body. Nick looks at the blood spatter at the scene and takes a sample of a frozen blood drop and a shotgun pellet, then finds an unidentified black object and collects it. Sara, meanwhile, dusts for prints.  The black object in the Big & Best freezer is identified as a fragment of a shotgun stock. A gray substance on the fragment is identified as adhesive; the conclusion is that the shotgun owner attempted a very inexpensive repair of the gun\\'s stock. Meanwhile, a man, George Bartell, enters the police department with blood on his hands, reporting a crime. Upon interrogation, he reveals that he sells expired ice cream for cash, and was going to let Al in on the scheme when they found someone smashing the candy machine. The gunman then brought Al and George to the freezer, shot Al, knocked out George and locked him in the trunk of his car. When George came to, he twisted a tire iron loose and opened the trunk to escape. George becomes a suspect, however, when a drop of blood is found on his pants; he is held for further questioning.  Looking over the situation in the warehouse and the single drop of blood on George\\'s pants, Nick and Sara initiate an experiment, showing that although blood spatter at room temperature will stay largely adherent to the surface it hits. However, spatter in a freezer tends to freeze immediately and bounce off as a number of pellets. They surmise, then, that such a pellet hit George\\'s pants and, given the angles, George could not be the shooter. While pondering the identity of the man behind the murder, they get word that George\\'s clothing also had a number of paint chips on it, all dual layered - factory-applied burgundy car paint topped with cheap blue house paint. This, combined with the cheap adhesive found on the gun fragment, lower Nick and Sara\\'s opinion of the killer.  The adhesive on the gunstock fragment is identified as granite surface adhesive. As there are few granite specialists in the area, this narrows the search for the gunman down considerably. A man named Virgil is brought in for questioning after being found in connection with both the car and the granite company. Despite the evidence, Virgil denies knowing Al Sesto, remains quiet and demands a lawyer.  George and Virgil see each other in the halls of the police department. Virgil, forgetting himself (and proving himself as dimwitted as the CSIs believed) explicitly admits to the murder by saying he \"should have shot [George] in that freezer.\" George realizes his absentmindedness when he remembers everything he\\'d innocently told Virgil, including the vending machines and Petey\\'s lax attendance on duty.

      "s04e22 ['Synopsis The CSIs investigate when two young gamblers are found dead shortly after scamming several of Sam Braun \\'s casinos .  Grissom is forced to take  Catherine off the case because  Catherine father is a suspect in their murder .   Plot Victims : Teddy Keller ( deceased ) , Davis Mullins ( deceased )   On the case : Entire team   In a dark room , a young man is questioned under a spotlight by two unseen people . One of the unseen people asks the young man if he knows what happened to people like him back in the day . The young man is sweating bullets while this interrogation is going on . He insists that he it \\'s illegal to hold him in the room ; the interrogator replies that there is no law in the room . The young man is later found dead in a neon graveyard with two shots to the back of the head .  Catherine ,  Grissom and  Brass are on the scene ;  Grissom notices that the victim is wearing a wig and a fat suit .  Brass finds the victim \\'s ID ; the victim \\'s name is Ernie Menlo . Robbery is ruled out for the time being since there is a still a Rolex on the victim \\'s wrist .   Later on ,  Catherine gets off of the phone with  Brass and relays the information to  Grissom that there is no Ernie Menlo in the system and that the ID is fake .  Grissom bags the wig as evidence and notes that there is gun shot residue in the wound tract ; the shots are close range , but non - contact .  Catherine is unable to find any shell casings and wonders if this was a professional hit and that the hitman picked up the casings . David Phillips looks over the body and notes that there are major fractures and lacerations on both of the victim \\'s hands . Lividity suggests that this was not a body dump .  Grissom bags some of the nearby gravel and glass as evidence . There are tire tracks in the dirt indicating that a vehicle made a three - point turn ;  Catherine photographs the tracks and whips out a tape measure to measure the wheelbase . Meanwhile ,  Grissom finds a receipt in the victim \\'s pocket ; the victim had won $ 436,278 at the Rampart Casino the previous morning .  Grissom shows the receipt to  Catherine and notes that robbery may be a motive after all . When  Catherine offers to go to the Rampart to speak to Sam Braun ,  Grissom tells  Catherine that , since Sam is  Catherine father ,  Catherine is off the case due to conflict of interest .  Catherine begrudgingly hands  Grissom  Catherine equipment and walks away .   In the morgue ,  Catherine and Warrick process the body ;  Catherine removes something from the victim \\'s forehead and bags it as evidence , while  Warrick works on the victim \\'s lacerated hand . David starts bagging the clothes as evidence , as well .  Catherine removes the victim \\'s Rolex and finds that it is authentic and that , since the logo sticker is n\\'t worn down , the watch could be new .  Warrick figures that the victim won the jackpot and celebrated by buying  Warrick some expensive stuff .  Warrick then finds that the victim is wearing air conditioned socks and that one of them has three holes in it .    Grissom and Brass head to the Rampart . While  Grissom looks up at the \" eye in the sky , \" Brass tells  Warrick that  Warrick talked to the pit boss that signed the victim \\'s W-2 and that the pit boss remembers the big winner . Soon thereafter , Sam Braun appears and tells  Grissom and Brass that the victim was cheating .  Grissom asks  Sam if  Grissom took the victim to the \" box \" ;  Sam replies that it \\'s now called \" The Holding Room . \"  Sam brings  Grissom to the room , which looks like the room the victim was sitting in at the beginning of the episode .  Grissom notes that the room smells like the cleaning staff just left .  Sam admits to  Grissom that the victim was brought to the room at 2:00 AM where  they talked for an hour ; the victim was then released .  Sam tells  Grissom that the security camera in the room recorded everything , and  Grissom replies that  they \\'ll look at the tapes later .  Grissom searches the room for evidence of blood , but does n\\'t find any . While  Grissom is doing this ,  Sam tells  Grissom that the victim was cheating at roulette and that  Grissom questioned the victim as to how  Grissom was doing it .  Sam then antagonizes  Grissom by asking  Sam what bothers  Sam more - the fact that they could n\\'t pin a murder on  Sam or the fact that  Catherine cashed the check  Grissom gave  Catherine .   Back in the morgue , Doc Robbins tells  Warrick that bruises on the victim \\'s heel correspond to the holes in his sock . The victim has a fat lip , which Doc Robbins believes occurred an hour or two before death . Two bullets are removed from the victim \\'s brain ;  Warrick says that they look like .22 caliber bullets , which Doc Robbins notes is a hitman \\'s bullet of choice . The doc also says that the bruises and fractures to the hands also occurred before death .  Warrick guesses that object used to fracture the hands was a ball peen hammer due to the fact that it used to be used back in the day to discourage cheaters .    Warrick goes over the victim \\'s clothing and looks over one of the shoes . On the underside of the shoe ,  Warrick finds shards of colored glass embedded in the treads .  Warrick removes the slip from the shoe and finds an elaborate series of buttons and switches tied to a battery .  Warrick finds  Grissom and tells  Warrick that , as far as  Warrick can tell , the device is a wireless receiver that picks up a signal and solenoids drive the points up against the victim \\'s foot , revealing what to bet on .  Grissom notes that if there is a receiver , there is a transmitter .  Sara interrupts  them and tells  them the victim \\'s real name is Teddy Keller ; his name and home address had been recorded when he bought the Rolex .   Warrick and Brass visit  Teddy \\'s apartment complex ; the manager , Joseph Greene , tells them that  Davis has a roommate named Davis Mullins . They enter the apartment , which  Warrick notes is freezing . There is a regulation roulette wheel on a table and various charts and graphs indicating that the roommates had a cheating system in place .  Brass searches the apartment and finds  Davis lying dead in the bedroom .  Davis has also received two gunshots to the back of the head .  Warrick notices a blood smear on the body , as well as a white mark on the shoulder . Meanwhile ,  Brass finds wigs and cosmetics in the closet and a box full of wireless receivers nearby , one of which has a print on the clear plastic covering . Outside of the apartment , Grissom finds shards of colored glass at the bottom of a stairwell .    Catherine is on a date with Chris Bezich when  Sam walks up on them .  Catherine tells  Sam that  Catherine can get fired just for having this conversation , but  Sam tells  Catherine that it \\'s a small town and  Sam \\'s always running into someone  Sam knows .  Sam tells  Catherine that some people think  Sam \\'s a murderer , but  Catherine angrily replies that some people know  Sam \\'s a murderer .  Sam puts a hand on  Catherine shoulder and tells  Catherine that  Sam did n\\'t kill those kids , implying that  Sam knows that there \\'s more than one .  Sam eventually gets into  Sam limousine ;  Catherine notices that  it makes a three - point turn before  it departs .   David Hodges tells  Grissom that the glass found in the apartment complex stairwell is consistent with the glass found at the first crime scene . Meanwhile , in the locker room ,  Nick tells  Sara that  Nick \\'s been recommended by  Grissom for the key CSI position ; however , the position was cut , as the department only had money for that or a bio robot .  Sara processes this information as  Nick tells  Sara it was just an honor to be nominated . Elsewhere ,  Grissom and  Warrick look over all of the roulette evidence gathered from the apartment .  Warrick tells  Warrick that  Warrick was reading up on a group of people that used physics to gain an advantage on the roulette wheel .  Warrick guesses that one of the guys did the calibration and noted the position of the ball and that the computer could play out the spin in milliseconds , predicting the result . The transmitter would then send the code to the receiver allowing the other person to place their bet .  Warrick says that this system gave  Davis and  Teddy a 44 % advantage over the house .  Nick walks in and says that they got a hit off of the print recovered from the transmitter in the shoe ; the print belongs Seth Landers , an electrical engineering grad student at WLVU .  Seth has a record , having gotten arrested a few years back for making fake IDs .    Nick and Brass go to the WLVU campus looking for  Seth , but find  Seth doom room empty . As they are walking away , they spot a student unlocking  Seth bike . Brass calls out  Seth \\'s name , and  Seth takes off running . When  Seth is caught ,  Seth yells out that  Seth does n\\'t want to be killed and that  Seth \\'ll do whatever Sam Braun wants .  Seth is brought to the station for interrogation . There ,  Seth tells Warrick and Brass that the scheme was  Davis and  Teddy \\'s idea and that  Seth did n\\'t even get a cut of the winnings ,  Seth just wanted to build the device to see if the plan could work . The plan was to win $ 20,000-$30,000 per night , but  Davis and  Teddy got greedy . They hit three different  Sam Braun - owned casinos since they \\'re low - tech and were less likely to cause interference with the transmitters .  Seth admits that  Seth saw  Teddy get taken to the \" box , \" but  Seth thought they were in the clear when  Teddy emerged with the money still in  Teddy possession . However ,  Teddy says that shortly after that ,  Teddy was apprehended again , and that \\'s the last time  Seth saw either  Davis or Teddy .    Catherine stops by  Grissom \\'s office and tells  Teddy of  Catherine run - in with  Sam .  Catherine lets  Teddy know that  Sam got into a limousine with a wide turning radius and convinces  Grissom that  Grissom should use  Grissom good character to get a warrant for the vehicle .  Grissom and  Sara process the limousine ; they find that the distance from front tire to rear tire is 20 feet .  Sara finds shards of colored glass in the rear tire treads , indicating that it was at the neon graveyard . They spray the back of the limousine with luminol and  Grissom finds traces of blood . While this is going on ,  Sara questions  Grissom as to why  Nick received the now - cut promotion and  Sara did n\\'t ;  Grissom replies that it \\'s because  Nick did n\\'t care whether  Grissom got the promotion or not . This answer is not good enough for  Sara .    Warrick and Brass go to the Rampart . They find  Sam , and Brass places  Sam under arrested for the murder of Teddy Keller . In the interrogation room ,  Grissom tells  Sam and  Sam lawyer that the tire patterns found at the scene of  Teddy \\'s murder are consistent with the wheel base and turning radius of  Sam \\'s limousine .  Grissom also mentions that the shards of colored glass were found in the treads of all four tires . Additionally , the blood found in the backseat was a match to  Teddy .  Brass guesses that  Sam waited until  Teddy cleared the security cameras and had  Teddy staff escort  Teddy to the limousine . There ,  Sam hit  Teddy with the back of  Sam hand , drawing blood .  They then took  Teddy to the neon graveyard to show what happens to cheaters -  They leaned  Teddy up against one of the signs and beat  Teddy with a hammer .  Sam whispers something to  Sam lawyer . The lawyer then tells  Grissom and Brass that  Sam simply offered  Teddy a ride home ; they took a detour to the neon graveyard to have a chat about the ethics of cheating and defrauding a casino .  Brass notes that  Teddy left the casino with the money , but the lawyer says  Teddy returned the money as a sign of respect .   At the Rampart ,  Warrick walks around with a miniature frequency counter to take some electronic noise measurements . Back in the lab , Hodges tells  Warrick that the white paint found on  Davis \\'s body was an interior paint with the color Navajo White .  Warrick meets up with  Grissom and tells  Warrick that the casino floor was a mess of interference and that electronics in old casinos are n\\'t shielded .  Warrick believes that  Seth would have known better than to use the old casinos for the scam and that maybe  Warrick was setting up  Warrick friends .  Warrick then searches for  Seth in the computer and brings up  Warrick driver \\'s license .  Warrick recognizes a past address ; it \\'s the apartment complex where  Davis and  Teddy lived . Ironically , apartment manager Joseph Greene has the same address .    Warrick and Brass find Joseph in a convenience store playing a slot machine . He reveals that  Seth is his son and wants to know if he \\'s okay . As Joseph goes to pull the slot machine lever again ,  Brass notices an injury to his hand . Joseph says it \\'s an old injury ; when  Warrick asks  Warrick if Sam Braun did that to  Warrick , he replies that he does n\\'t know who that is . Nevertheless , Joseph is brought to the police station for questioning .   At the station , Sam Braun is escorted to the waiting room and given a seat next to Joseph . Joseph stares long and hard at  Sam while  Grissom and Brass watch the interaction from a distance . Brass tells  Grissom that Joseph ( aka Joseph Landers ) and  Sam are old friends . An officer comes in to escort Joseph to interrogation ;  Sam notices the bruises on Joseph \\'s hand and gleefully asks him if it hurts when it rains . Once again , Joseph feigns ignorance and pretends to not know who  Sam is .   In interrogation ,  Brass brings up the fact that Joseph was banned from all casinos for cheating in the past . In fact , he had been caught cheating in one of Sam Braun \\'s casinos . Joseph claims that he did n\\'t cheat and that he simply beat the casinos . Brass guesses that the plan the boys hatched was Joseph \\'s plan and that he put his son , Seth , in the middle of it . He even wonders if  Seth killed his two partners . Joseph categorically denies this and says that they should be looking at  Sam for the murders .   At the WLVU campus ,  garbage is found in  Seth \\'s dumpster . Amongst  garbage garbage is a .22 caliber revolver with four expended rounds wrapped in a bloody green t - shirt . In the lab , test shots are fired from the gun ;  Warrick finds that the test bullet matches the bullet found in  Teddy \\'s body . However ,  Warrick is still unsettled about the case - why would  Seth come up with a plan to scam the casinos and kill  Seth partners , but leave the gun in  Seth dorm ? Furthermore , the .22 caliber revolver is a small weapon for an up - close - and - personal hit . There were two different types of ammo in the gun ;  Nick and  Warrick are able to do some backtracking and they find that  Davis was actually killed before  Teddy was . Their timeline is off .    Greg finds  Grissom and tells  Greg that the blood recovered from the t - shirt in the dumpster belongs to Davis Mullins ; however , epithelials on the inside of the shirt belong to  Seth .  Grissom is seemingly disappointed with the results , as this means that  Sam is innocent of the murders .  Warrick visits  Seth in  Warrick cell and asks  Warrick what  Warrick did after  Teddy was hauled away .  Seth reveals that  Seth waited outside of the casino for an hour ; when  Teddy did n\\'t show up ,  Seth went to  Teddy \\'s apartment to look for  Teddy . There ,  Seth found  Davis dead in the bedroom .  Seth touched  Davis \\'s body and got blood on  Seth hands , which  Seth absent mindedly wiped on  Seth shirt . When confronted with the fact that the gun was found wrapped in  Seth bloody t - shirt ,  Seth insists that  Seth \\'s never fired a gun in  Seth life .  Seth is also surprised that the shirt was found outside of  Seth dorm room .  Warrick has  Seth retrace  Warrick steps , and  Seth remembers that  Warrick came to  Warrick father in a panic and handed  Warrick the bloody shirt .  Seth comes to the realization that  Seth was set up by this father .  Seth admits that  Seth just wanted  Seth father to like  Seth and  Seth went to scam Sam Braun as a way of proving  Seth to  Seth .    Grissom and  Warrick head to the apartment complex to look for evidence that incriminates Joseph . They find nothing in Joseph \\'s apartment ; however ,  Grissom finds traces of white paint on a key ring handle , as well as one of the keys . The key opens the door to an apartment that is in the process of being painted .  Warrick finds a paint can in the middle of the floor and notes that the color is Navajo White , the same paint that was on  Davis \\'s shirt . In the closet ,  Grissom finds a backpack full of money from both Pike \\'s Casino and the Tangiers ; additionally , there are paint and blood smears on the backpack .  Warrick wonders why Joseph would kill the kids when they were making him money and helping him get revenge on  Sam .  Grissom guesses that when Joseph saw the opportunity to frame  Sam for murder , it stopped being about the money . A flashback shows Joseph getting a call from  Teddy telling him that  Sam was on to the scam . Joseph went to their apartment and shot  Davis , then went to the neon graveyard where  Teddy was waiting for  Teddy and shot  Teddy , as well . He then beat  Teddy \\'s hands with a hammer and propped  Teddy up against a sign .    Catherine meets up with  Sam and offers to buy  Teddy dinner as an apology .  Catherine learns that  Sam has hired  Seth as an opportunity to work off  Seth debt . \" You want to catch a cheater - you hire one , \"  Teddy tells  Catherine . Before  Teddy leaves ,  Teddy adds that one way or another ,  Teddy always gets  Teddy money \\'s worth .']\n",
      "s04e21 ['Synopsis Grissom ,  Nick and Sara investigate when a roller coaster derails at an amusement park , leaving six people dead . When it turns out there were only five people on the roller coaster , they suspect foul play . Catherine and Warrick investigate the murder of a 13-year old girl .   Plot Victim : Multiple victims ( deceased )   On the case : Gil Grissom , Nick Stokes , Sara Sidle , Jim Brass   At Sphinx Amusement Park , a family of four rides the roller coaster called \" Pharaoh \\'s Fever . \" They disembark and walk to a nearby stand to order something to eat . Suddenly , screams are heard and the cars are shown flying off of the track and into the parking lot , crushing a car . Later , Grissom arrives on the scene , where Brass tells him that six people are dead .    Nick and  Sara soon arrive on the scene with  Greg in tow . Grissom tells them that due to the criminal and civil liabilities issues , they have to keep it quiet and not talk to the press . After Grissom gives them orders and asks if there any questions ,  Greg asks him why one victim is so far away from the others . Grissom notes that this is curious , but simply walks away .  Sara tells  Greg that  Sara guess is that the victim did n\\'t have his seat belt buckled , so he flew further than the other victims on the ride .    Sara photographs the evidence in the parking lot , while  Nick bags  it and  Greg documents  it . Meanwhile ,  Brass talks to ride operator Zack Lawrence , who tells  him that the training  him received to operate the ride was to release the hand brake and hit the \" Go \" button when the light was green . Brass asks  Zack to remember who was on the ride , and  Zack only remembers five people . There is a vendor booth nearby with a sign that reads \" See Yourself Scream \" ;  Zack tells  Brass that an on - ride digital camera takes photos of the passengers and stores them in the computer \\'s hard drive . Despite the train being airborne and not reaching the part of the ride where the camera is ,  Brass says that  Brass \\'re going to need the computer .   Elsewhere ,  Grissom questions Woody , the park \\'s chief engineer .  Woody insists that all of the rides are up to code and did n\\'t think an accident like this was possible . During the conversation ,  Grissom spots a piece of metal on the ground and picks it up with  Grissom pen .  Woody says that it \\'s a nut that secures the wheel to the screw ; however ,  Grissom claims that one loose wheel could n\\'t cause a whole train to derail . For that to happen , all eight wheels would have to be loose .  Grissom then visits Nick , Sara and Greg in the large tent they set up in the parking lot where the evidence is being held .  Grissom tells them  Grissom \\'s looking for a screw , and Nick hands  Grissom a container full of them .  Grissom observes that the end threads on the screws were stripped , which means the nuts were loose .  Grissom also finds tool marks that left vertical striations and Nick guesses that a pipe wrench could have been used .   Doc Robbins has the bodies lined up in the morgue and gives  Grissom and rundown of their names and causes of death . One of the victims is Jim Nevins , a 20-year old park employee who died from an impact to the head .  Grissom notes that  Zack told  Zack that only five people were on the coaster and that none of them were employees of the park .  Grissom wonders if  Jim was in the wrong place at the wrong time and got hit by a falling roller coaster , but Doc Robbins informs  Grissom that  Jim \\'s rigor mortis and body temperature put  Grissom time of death sixteen hours before the other victims around 1:00 AM .    Grissom and  Sara head back to the park and examine the underside of the coaster \\'s loading platform . They see that the wheels would have been in reach and that anyone could have had access to tamper with them .  Sara finds what looks like lubricant on the track and swabs it for evidence . The sound of metal on metal draws  Grissom \\'s attention ;  Woody tells  Woody that  it \\'s a detached support beam , but  it \\'s just a cosmetic problem .  Woody had fixed the beam several times during the year and recorded it in  Woody maintenance log . As Woody talks to  Grissom and  Sara , they notice a pipe wrench in Woody \\'s tool bag and bag it as evidence . Meanwhile , Nick gives  Grissom a call and tells him that  Jim \\'s body was covered in trilobal red fibers ;  Grissom guesses that the fibers are from a car \\'s interior .   In the parking lot tent ,  Greg tells  Grissom and Sara that the roller coaster broke into 106 different parts ; however , he found one that thing that is n\\'t supposed to belong - semen .  Grissom informs them that the release of epinephrine and adrenaline while riding a coaster could produce a stimulatory effect .  Grissom then notices a red T - Bird , which  Greg tells  Grissom belongs to Jim Nevins , the dead park employee .  Sara finds a pipe wrench in the back seat of the car that has blood on it , while  Grissom discovers that there is a blood pool in the trunk .  Grissom wonders if  Jim was hit over the head with a pipe wrench and stuffed in the trunk of  Grissom own car , lying in a pool of blood . The roller coaster hitting the car would have ejected  Jim from the trunk , which would be more in line with their findings so far .  Sara finds this far - fetched , but  Grissom says that  Grissom \\'s just following the evidence .    Brass has Zack Lawrence called into the station for questioning . Zack tells him that he remembers  Jim \\'s T - Bird being in the parking lot when he closed up the amusement park at 10:00 PM the night before the accident . He says that  Jim would sometimes stay in the park after closing and take his dates on the coaster , which was no big deal to his fellow employees . However , Zack does n\\'t know the name of  Jim \\'s date from the night before the accident . Brass wonders how  Jim got access to the park at night if all of the power was shut down ; Zack tells him that the same key that opens the men \\'s room door also opens up all of the power boxes in the park . There is also no security , as the last security guard got laid off during a round of budget cuts .    Nick takes mold samples of the two pipe wrenches and finds that the tool marks from the sabotaged nut are a match to the wrench found in the T - Bird .  Nick tells Grissom that  Nick theory is that  Jim loosed the screws on the coaster , then was attacked when  Nick left the park and killed with  Nick own wrench .  Nick also says that  Nick got a partial print off of the wrench and that it matched one of the two sets of prints found on the T - Bird \\'s trunk ; the other print is unknown .  Greg enters and tells Grissom and  Nick that the semen found in the coaster belonged to  Jim and  Greg relays the information that  Jim used to take dates on coaster rides .  Nick believes  Nick theory is no good , as nobody would sabotage their own \" sex machine . \"   Sara goes through the on - ride photos from the computer the park sent over . She is looking at the day of the accident , but  Nick has her go back in time , as  Nick is aware of  Jim \\'s escapades . Sure enough ,  they find  Jim riding the coaster with a girl ; the timestamp is 12:45 AM , fifteen minutes before  Jim death .  they know  they need to find the girl in the photo .  Grissom and  Sara visit the amusement park again to look for the girl . They run into Woody , who identifies the girl as \" Cleopartra \" and  Grissom tells them she works in food services . They find \" Cleopatra \" on break ; she tells them that her real name is Lisa Hunt .  Lisa tells  Grissom and Sara that  Lisa had no idea the on - ride camera worked at night .  Lisa admits that  Lisa had always had a crush on  Jim , and that  Lisa agreed to go out with  Jim when  Jim asked  Lisa .  Grissom asks  Lisa what  they did after the coaster ride ;  Lisa says that  they talked and kissed .  Jim offered to drive  Lisa home , but  Lisa decided to walk since  Lisa does n\\'t live far away .  Sara asks  Lisa if  Sara noticed anyone else around ;  Lisa says no , but admits that  Lisa was n\\'t really looking .   David Hodges pulls  Sara into his lab and informs  Sara that the substance  Sara collected from the track is doxepin ointment , which is prescribed to treat dermatological inflammations caused by coming into contact with certain types of plants .  Sara guesses that whoever messed with the coaster rubbed up against the track , transferring the ointment ; Hodges tells  Sara that their killer has a rash . With this knowledge ,  Sara checks the pharmaceutical database and finds that doxepin has only been prescribed to twelve people in Clark County ; Lisa Hunt is one of those names .   In interrogation ,  Lisa admits to  Grissom and  Sara that  Lisa had a rash on  Lisa leg and used  doxepin to get rid of  doxepin . When asked how  Lisa got the rash ,  Lisa says  Lisa was studying with someone in the grass and rubbed on something when they went for a walk . It turns out that the person  Lisa was with was  Lisa math tutor , Zack Lawrence .  Lisa confirms that Zack also had the rash , as  Lisa gave him some of  Lisa ointment .    Sara and  Brass visit Zack at the amusement park , where he is sweeping the merry - go - round . Zack confirms that he used some of  Lisa \\'s ointment ;  Sara says that it \\'s actually illegal to use someone else \\'s prescription . Zack lays his broom aside as  Brass takes him away for more questioning and  Sara dusts the broom for prints . In interrogation , Zack shows  Grissom and  Sara  Grissom rash .  Sara tells  Grissom that the prints lifted from  Grissom broom match the prints on  Jim \\'s T - Bird and the prints on the pipe wrench .    Sara points out that Zack is a straight \" A \" student with a scholarship to Stanford University . When pressed , Zack admits that he had feelings for Lisa , which is why he took a $ 12/hour job at the amusement park when he \\'s already making $ 20/hour tutoring . He got jealous when he found out  Jim was taking  Lisa on one of his \" coaster dates \" and loosened the screws on the coaster . The problem is , he did n\\'t loosen them enough . Zack went to Plan B and attacked  Jim in the parking lot with a pipe wrench , then stuffed the body in trunk of the T - Bird .  Sara asks Zack why he did n\\'t tighten the screws after his plan failed , and Zack replies that he just did n\\'t think about it . That cost five other people their lives .   Victim : Tessa Press ( deceased )   On the case : Catherine Willows , Warrick Brown    Catherine and Warrick are called to the scene where the body of 13-year old Tessa Press has been found . They meet David Phillips at the scene ;  Catherine immediately notices that the body position is inconsistent with the lividity . Lividity shows that Tessa died face - down , but someone had dumped her face - up .  David rolls the body to show  Catherine the instar maggots that are crawling over Tessa \\'s back . Based on the temperature and the previous night \\'s rainfall ,  David estimates that Tessa has been in her current location for 24 hours . The rain may have washed away most of the evidence , so  Catherine and  Warrick hope that there is enough evidence still on the body .  David wonders why someone would take the time to drive out and dump the body , but not take extra time to bury it so nobody would find it .   In the police station ,  Raina \\'s mother Raina positively identifies  Raina daughter \\'s body from the autopsy photo .  Warrick tells her that Tessa died over 24 hours ago ;  Raina replies that she did n\\'t report her daughter missing because she would sleep over at a friend \\'s house a few nights per week . Since she works nights , but that she is home when Tessa would get home from school . When Tessa did n\\'t come home that day ,  Raina assumed that she was at the friend \\'s house .   In autopsy ,  David tells  Warrick that Tessa \\'s had a lacerated spinal cord and that her cause of death was asphyxia due to diaphragmatic paralysis .  Warrick notices that there is soil inside of the neck wound ;  Warrick finds this odd , noting that soil should be around the wound and on it , but not inside of it .  Catherine and  Warrick visit a mini mart not far from where Tessa would get off the school bus . The manager has told  Warrick that  Catherine recognized Tessa and remembered seeing  Catherine the day  Catherine was killed . They also confirmed that Tessa would spend at least two nights per week at her friend \\'s house ; however , there was no set schedule and the friend \\'s parents figured Tessa was at home hen she did n\\'t show up .  Catherine spots a security camera in the mini mart \\'s parking lot ;  Warrick tells  Catherine that  Warrick has already secured the footage .    Warrick is able to find Tessa in the security camera footage ; there ,  Warrick sees a boy grabbing her arm and trying to take her away . They are able to identify the boy as 15-year old Henry Capana , who tells  Catherine and  Warrick that  Warrick would sit next to Tessa on the school bus .  Warrick says that  Warrick felt sorry for Tessa , as other kids would make fun of her hair and clothing .  Henry explains that  Henry had just gotten  Henry learner \\'s permit and that  Henry was simply offering a ride to Tessa . Tessa declined , telling  Henry that someone was coming to pick her up .  Henry says that  Henry saw Tessa get into a truck , but  Henry did n\\'t see who was driving it .    Warrick meets up with  Catherine and tells  Catherine that the trace inside Tessa \\'s wound is zoodoo , a compost made up of the feces of different animals that keeps deer away .  Zoodoo is imported from Auckland , New Zealand , and is used by one company in Clark County called ADL Landscaping .  Warrick finds out that Tessa \\'s mother , Raina , hired  ADL a few months back for a job . They head to  Raina \\'s house and see an  ADL truck in the driveway with tools in the truck bed ;  Catherine finds this odd , as  Zoodoo company was hired months ago . When they knock on the door ,  Raina answers with  Raina boyfriend , Justin Mack ;  Justin is wearing an  ADL shirt .   While  Catherine talks to  Raina inside the house ,  Warrick questions  Justin outside in the driveway .  Justin says that Tessa would take the bus home from school , but that he would sometimes pick her up from school , buy her an ice cream cone , and drop her off at her house . With  Justin \\'s permission ,  Warrick tests the tools in the truck for blood and finds evidence of blood on a shovel . Meanwhile ,  Raina tells  Catherine that  Justin is a good man and that he would never hurt anyone , especially Tessa .   The evidence is processed - the blood on the shovel is Tessa \\'s , while the fingerprints lifted from the handle of the shovel belong to  Raina . A flashback shows  Warrick spraying luminol in the backseat of  Raina \\'s car and finding evidence of blood . In interrogation ,  Warrick tells  Raina that the weapon used and the method of body disposal do not suggest premediated murder . As  Raina gets angrier during the interrogation ,  Catherine asks what set  Catherine off .  Raina complains to  Catherine that  Catherine bought Tessa a bus pass , but  Catherine would still get a ride home from school with  Justin . A clearly unhinged  Raina accused Tessa of trying to steal  Justin away from her . As Tessa denied this and walked away from their argument ,  Raina grabbed a shovel and hit Tessa in the back of the head .  Catherine incensed  Catherine berates  Raina for killing  Catherine 13-year old child and leaves the interrogation room .']\n",
      "s05e08 ['Synopsis The CSI team investigate when a woman is found with her throat slashed . They soon discover that the woman underwent a sex change operation and have to delve into the world of the Las Vegas transgender community to find the killer .   Plot Victim : Wendy Garner ( deceased )   On the case : Entire team   A woman is speeding down a dark highway and gets pulled over by an officer . She tells the officer that she is being followed and has video to prove it ; however , the officer does n\\'t believe her and asks for her license and registration . The woman is next seen in her car with her throat and private parts slashed .  Catherine and Grissom are on the scene ; there , they find a camcorder with no tape in it and tire tracks insinuating that the victim was run off the road .   In autopsy , David Phillips tells  Catherine that the victim had lots of surgical procedures : artificial breasts , cheek implants , and collagen lips . Meanwhile , Sara and Warrick process the victim \\'s car .  Warrick finds a woman \\'s cosmetic bag containing various creams and lotions , while Sara finds the victim \\'s work card under a floor mat . In the glove compartment ,  Warrick finds the car \\'s registration and a driver \\'s license . Both belong to Walter Clancy , leading Sara to believe that the victim either borrowed the car or stole it .   Doc Robbins tells  Catherine and Grissom the surprising news - during his examination of the victim , he found a prostate , meaning that the victim is actually a male . The victim had undergone genital realignment surgery , changing male parts into female parts . The victim \\'s cause of death was a severed carotid artery and jugular complex and the cuts were made with a very sharp instrument . Doc Robbins guesses that the attacker was someone emotionally involved , and  Catherine guesses that things escalated from a sexual assault to a hate crime .   Brass talks to Officer Mann , the officer who pulled the victim over . He recounts the events - the victim was speeding and he pulled her over . The victim told him that she was being chased and she had video to prove it ; however , he did n\\'t bite . She then told him that the car belonged to her brother and that she did n\\'t have her license , but she had her brother \\'s license instead . Officer Mann says he let the victim off with a warning which  Brass thinks is too light . Brass hypothesizes that Officer Mann was turned on and met the victim further up the road in a secluded spot . While they making out , he find out the victim was a male and reacted violently . Officer Mann , who already has sexual harassment flag in his file , denies this .  Brass puts him on administrative duty until the case is resolved and asks for a DNA sample .   In the A / V lab ,  Catherine informs Warrick and  Archie that the fingerprints run through  AFIS came back with two results - Wendy Garner , a dancer at the Tangiers , and Walter Clancy , a blackjack dealer at the Riviera in the 90 \\'s . With the two photos side by side ,  Archie removes all of  Wendy \\'s surgical enhancements . They find that  Wendy and Walter are the same person , with  Walter becoming  Wendy after the genital realignment surgery . Mia Dickerson tells  Sara that  Wendy \\'s mouth had two foreign DNA donors , but none of them match Officer Mann .  Sara , meanwhile , has  Wendy \\'s diamond ring under a microscope and is able to find a serial number etched into it .    Grissom and Brass speak to  Wendy \\'s fiancee , Aaron Laner , in  Grissom home .  Aaron says that  Aaron had known Wendy for a year and that they had met in a grief support group where  Wendy was mourning the loss of  Wendy \" twin brother , \"  Walter .  Sara walks through the house and discovers that  Aaron and  Wendy were sleeping in separate beds . In the bathroom , there are separate sinks . In the cabinet on  Wendy \\'s side ,  Sara finds several bottles of pills along with a note indicating when each pill should be taken .  Sara also curiously finds a bloody pad in the garbage . As Grissom ,  Sara and Brass leave the house ,  Grissom says that it \\'s impossible that  Wendy had  Wendy period due to  Wendy surgery . They contemplate telling  Aaron about  Wendy \\'s past , but  Grissom wonders if  Aaron already knew .    Catherine and  Grissom head to the Tangiers and speak to  Wendy \\'s fellow dancers . The dancers say that they knew  Wendy was a transexual , but they say that all of the best showgirls are .  Catherine asks where one would go to get work done and they are told to go see Dr. Mercer . In the doctor \\'s office , Dr. Mercer tells  Catherine and Warrick that the law requires that re - gender candidates have to spend one year on hormones and one year living as their sex preference .  Wendy wanted to fast - track the process , but Dr. Mercer refused . The doctor adds that the surgery is the easy part , but the hard part is adjusting to life afterwards . He is shocked and saddened to hear that  Wendy did n\\'t commit suicide and that  Wendy was murdered .    Mia informs Sara that the blood collected from the pad was  Wendy \\'s and that it contained traces of EDTA , an anticoagulant . Since the blood contained no epithelials or fibrinogen , however , it is not menstrual . They conclude that  Wendy has having blood drawn and putting it on the pad to fake  Wendy period .  Mia guesses that  Wendy had to have someone helping  Mia do that and Sara wonders if that someone is Dr. Mercer . Meanwhile ,  Greg tells  Grissom that all of the pills recovered from  Wendy \\'s cabinet were Mexican knockoffs since HMOs in the United States do n\\'t consider being differently - sexed a life - threatening condition . The pills range from heavy - duty hormonal supplements to tranquillizers and antibiotics . During the conversation ,  Grissom gets a call from Mimosa , one of the dancers , and agrees to meet  Mia for lunch . At the lounge ,  Mimosa tells  Grissom that  Mia was going to be Wendy \\'s maid of honor at  Mia wedding .  Wendy then called  Mimosa and was hysterical , showing great concern for a video tape .  Mimosa adds that , in the end ,  Wendy was tearing  Wendy apart for a reasons unknown to  Wendy .  Mimosa also confirms that Aaron did n\\'t know about  Wendy \\'s past .  Mimosa says that  Wendy revealed all of this in group therapy and tells Grissom that the doctor \\'s name is Dr. Lavelle .   In the lab ,  Warrick photographs the clothes  Wendy was wearing the night  Wendy was murdered .  Wendy interrupts and tells  Warrick the blood on  Wendy \\'s shoes did not match  Wendy or Officer Mann and that the blood belongs to a male . Meanwhile , Grissom and Brass visit the Lepidro Clinic to speak to Dr. Lavelle . There , they meet Francis Lavelle and his daughter , Tippi , mistaking  Francis for the doctor . After being corrected , they speak to Dr. Mona Lavelle . She tells them that  Wendy originally came to her devastated that she was denied surgery and she tried to help her work through that .  Wendy lacked patience , Dr. Lavelle says , and that made  Wendy an unacceptable candidate for surgery . The doctor says that  Wendy saw  Wendy the night  Wendy was murdered for an individual consultation .  Wendy was worried that what  Wendy husband would do when he found out and refused to have him come with  Wendy to the group sessions and/or find out the truth . Dr. Lavelle also tells  Brass that  Wendy never videotapes the sessions , as that would violate doctor - patient privilege .   In the A / V lab ,  Nick and Warrick pull up a map and mark off  Wendy \\'s address , the address of the doctor \\'s office , and the location where  Wendy was pulled over for speeding .  Nick says that  Wendy left Dr. Lavelle at 8:00 PM and was pulled over at 8:24 PM .  Wendy was found dead two miles south of where  Wendy was pulled over ; however , they figured out that it only takes ten minutes to drive from the clinic to the crime scene , leaving fourteen minutes unaccounted for . They look at one of the post - it notes that  Sara took from  Wendy \\'s bathroom cabinet that reads \" G-105 , Section E \" with numbers underneath it .  Nick mentions that there a lot of storage facilities in the area near the crime scene . Catherine ,  Nick and  Warrick head to the storage facility . As they walk down the hall , they see bloody shoeprints on the ground .  Nick is able to open the lock using the combination from the post - it note . Inside , they find a surgical table with a dead woman on it and blood everywhere .   Catherine ,  Nick and  Warrick photograph and process the scene .  Nick asks for  Catherine \\'s take on the situation , and  Catherine comments that the victim outsourced  Catherine operation to the wrong doctor .  Brass enters and says that the facility manager told him that the renter paid cash and \" seemed normal . \" The body is brought to autopsy , where Doc Robbins finds piano wires on the x - ray of the lower abdomen . After a rather grotesque description on what they are used for , he tells  Catherine that the victim seems to have gone in for a repair on an infection . The doc puts the victim \\'s death at two days ago , meaning that it happened before  Wendy \\'s death . The cause of death is labeled as accidental , with Doc Robbins telling  Catherine that it looks like the victim \\'s surgery was botched and  Catherine ended up being \" repaired to death . \"   As they go over the evidence from the storage shed ,  Catherine finds a fingerprint on a bloody fingerprint on a toothpaste tube and  Mia collects sweat from the inside of one of the bloody gloves .  Nick runs the fingerprints through  AFIS and finds a match to Vern Saldusky , who has aliases of Tawny , Peaches and Vava .  Vern \\'s last known address was at the Cockpit Lounge , a club run by transgenders .  Grissom and  Nick visit the establishment asking about  Vern and are told to speak to  Mercedes . As they walk to the back of the club , several people are shown getting silicone injections into their cheeks .  Grissom questions  Mercedes about doctors who perform surgeries for cheap and  Catherine mentions the name \" Benway . \"  Mercedes says that  Benway botched  Benway surgery and that a friend of  Benway had to see  Benway four times .  Benway does n\\'t know  Benway \\'s whereabouts , only that  Grissom is around to perform the surgery and that  Grissom is gone before the patient wakes up .  Nick asks  Mercedes if  Benway knows  Vern ;  Mercedes tells him that  Benway just did \" Tawny \\'s \" surgery .   In the break room ,  Catherine tells  Sara and Warrick that the fingerprint from the toothpaste tube came back to a Dr. Karl Benway .  Sara adds that the abdominal retractor they found is only sold in surgical supply stores and that , other than hospitals , the only person to acquire one in the Vegas area in the last 1 1/2 years is Dr. Benway .  Grissom and  Nick enter , with  Nick happy to share the information they have on the doctor ; however , everyone in the room already knows .  Sara tells  Grissom that Dr. Benway is not registered with the AMA , does not have a driver \\'s license , and no passport issued in the state of Nevada .  Greg comes in and says that , after extensive research ,  Greg found that Dr. Benway was a medic in the Vietnam War .  Greg was later arrested in Mexico and deported for performing illegal abortions .  Greg puts a mugshot of Dr. Benway on the table which  Grissom examines . Dr. Benway was also photographed protesting at the Supreme Court , and  Grissom recognizes a similarity in the photos between Dr. Benway and Dr. Mona Lavelle .   Dr. Lavelle is brought in for interrogation . There , she admits to having been Karl Benway in a past life and also admits to performing surgery on  Vern . She tells  Grissom and Brass her life story and how she has always helped those who have been cast out by gender politics .  Grissom reminds her that she has been performing surgeries without a medical license . Dr. Lavelle admits that  Vern \\'s death was an unfortunate accident , but claims that she does n\\'t know what happened to  Wendy . Brass guesses that  Wendy saw Dr. Lavelle with  Vern and threatened to expose  Wendy , resulting in  Wendy death . Dr. Lavelle , however , maintains that  Wendy went straight to  Wendy daughter \\'s soccer game after  Wendy session with  Wendy at the clinic .  Grissom obtains the doctor \\'s DNA .    Wendy informs  Catherine that  Wendy found female DNA in one of the bloody gloves in the storage facility . Since both Dr. Lavelle and  Vern were both males , this means that someone else was present during the surgery .  Nick and  Warrick search the Lavelle \\'s house , much to the anger of Dr. Lavelle \\'s husband , Francis . After Fracis yells at them and is escorted outside ,  Nick swabs some spit from a table . In the utility room ,  Warrick finds vials of clear liquid along with a camcorder video cartridge with the film pulled out . They hear more yelling coming from outside ; Amber Hamshaw has arrived to drop off  Tippi .  Francis tells  Amber to take  Tippi away ; when  Amber says that  Amber ca n\\'t ,  Francis tells  Amber that  Tippi is \"  Amber kid , too \" and that  Amber should take some responsibility .  Amber relents , finishes smoking  Amber cigarette , and drops it to the ground .  Nick walks over to it and collects it as evidence .    Amber is brought in for questioning .  Nick tells  Amber that the DNA from the cigarette butt matched the sweat found inside of the bloody glove , placing  Amber at  Vern \\'s surgery .  Amber explains that Dr. Lavelle and Francis are like family to  Amber ; they helped  Amber become a surrogate mother to  Tippi and paid for  Amber nursing degree . However ,  Amber also says that  Amber was at  Tippi \\'s soccer game when  Wendy was murdered .  Brass is later able to confirm this with other soccer moms that were in attendance .    Warrick and Archie look at the contents of the video cartridge and find footage of  Wendy \\'s bridal shower . Suddenly , the footage is interrupted with footage from the storage unit .  Vern \\'s dead body is on the operating table and  Wendy is crying , saying that  Wendy just wanted to keep  Wendy secret from  Wendy husband and wondered how Dr. Lavelle could do this to someone . The footage then goes back to the bridal shower .  Greg intervenes and says that the fingerprints recovered from the video cartridge came back to Francis Lavelle .   In interrogation ,  Brass tells  Francis that  Wendy videotaped the storage area in an effort to expose Dr. Lavelle \\'s \" good work \" because the doctor was threatening to tell  Wendy \\'s finacee that  Wendy was n\\'t what  Wendy appeared to be .  Catherine adds that based on DNA found in  Wendy \\'s cheek ,  Francis was having an affair with  Catherine .  Francis admits to being faithful to  Francis wife and having had a sexual rendezvous with her earlier in the day . A flashback shows  Francis driving to the storage facility to get rid of  Vern \\'s body . There ,  Francis sees  Wendy leaving and getting into  Wendy car .  Francis followed  Wendy and eventually killed  Wendy for trying to expose  Francis wife \\'s work .    Catherine is somewhat surprised that  Francis would admit to murder but not infidelity .  Sara guesses that after  Francis sexual act earlier in the day ,  Francis transferred DNA over to  Wendy while  Francis was killing  Sara . Meanwhile ,  Grissom talks to Mimosa in  Grissom office and informs  Sara that  Wendy was killed by someone in  Wendy community .']\n",
      "s02e09 ['Synopsis Grissom ,  Warrick and Nick investigate when three men dressed as women rob a casino . Meanwhile , Catherine and Sara are sent to investigate a murder at a remote convenience store . They soon discover the two cases are related and more bodies start turning up .   Plot Victim : Multiple victims ( deceased )   On the case : entire team   During a busy day in a casino , security guards go around collecting money . Suddenly , three women enter and start shooting , with one shooting down a chandelier . When the chaos ends , five security guards are dead as well as one of the shooters . The two other shooters stole the lock boxes from the rolling cage near the high stakes tables . Brass leads  Grissom to the dead shooter where Grissom removes the victim \\'s wig , revealing the assailant to be male .    Warrick finds a shell casing from a .45 , while Brass informs Grissom that there was robbery with a similar M.O. a month ago in  Laughlin .  Grissom guesses that the  Laughlin robbery was a practice round . Brass interviews manager Max Duncan , who claims  Grissom hit the deck once the chandelier was shot . This gives  Grissom a starting point to investigate - the chandelier falls , distracting the guards enough for them to be shot . During the chaos , the money is stolen and taken out the exit away from the action .   Brass interviews 17 people and finds that nobody \\'s story is the same . Outside , a valet tells  Nick that a tan car was parked with it \\'s hazards on . Before  Nick could call for a tow , the car sped away .  Nick finds brown transmission fluid in the spot , which  Nick notes as odd .    Nick Robbins informs  Grissom that the cross - dressing victim was Adam Brower and that  Grissom was shot in the back at close range with .45 caliber hollow point bullet . It mushroomed on impact causing major internal damage . Since the security guards at the casino had 9 mm guns ,  Grissom surmises that Brower might have been shot by one of his accomplices .    Warrick goes over the casino surveillance footage and finds when the suspects - labeled as Red , Blue , and Black ( based on clothing ) - entered and started shooting . Blue is determined to be the deceased , Adam Brower .  Grissom has  Warrick zoom in on Red , and the two clearly see that  Grissom is a man dressed as a woman . Upon zooming in on Black , however , they see no Adam \\'s apple or beard stubble . Black is a woman dressed as a woman among men dressed as women ... quite a disguise .    Nick gets the results back on the transmission fluid  Nick found and comes to the conclusion that the wrong fluid was put in the vehicle . This caused the vehicle to lose its second gear , meaning it probably did n\\'t get very far after the heist .  Brass and  Warrick search Adam \\'s apartment .  Warrick bags Adam \\'s clothes , as they may tell where  Nick was before the heist .  Brass opens a closet and finds wigs and bras on the closet floor .   Meanwhile ,  Catherine and  Sara drive 75 miles out of town to a shooting in a convenience store in a remote town of 20 people . Before taking off , officer William Spencer lets  Catherine and Sara know that the victim is behind the counter with the cash register emptied . They find shreds of potato on the floor , which means the potato was likely used a silencer .  Sara notes that the last paying customer was eight hours ago , but that the body had just been discovered . It \\'s possible the assailant flipped the \" Open \" sign to \" Closed . \"  Catherine spots a surveillance camera .  Sara disconnects  it and removes  it , only to find that  it \\'s a fake - a nine - volt battery attached to a blinking light .    Catherine is able to find prints on the cardboard Open / Closed sign , while  Sara , guessing that the suspect hopped the counter to steal the money , is able to lift footprints from the counter . Based on the small shoeprints , they deduce that the suspect could be a minor . Later ,  Catherine begins to get agitated as coroner David Phillips is several hours late . He arrives as  Sara is looking over the suspect using a mirror .   In the lab ,  Sara discovers that the shoeprints found on the convenience store counter belonged to a female wearing size five shoes .  Catherine , meanwhile , discovers that one of the prints lifted from the Open / Closed sign came back to officer Spencer . The prints from the register come back to Tammy Felton , the girl who tried to play  Catherine a year earlier .  Catherine tells  Sara that Tammy uses people and that  Catherine certainly did n\\'t act alone .   While  Catherine lets Grissom know that Tammy Felton has returned ,  Greg summons Grissom to the lab with  Catherine in tow .  Greg says that  Greg found traces of potato on the bullet that killed Adam Brower , with  Catherine noting that a potato was used in the convenience story robbery .  Sara interrupts and says that a fingerprint was lifted from the store \\'s doorknob and that it belongs to Darin Hanson .  Catherine notes that Darin and Tammy are running together like Bonnie and Clyde .   Bobby Dawson confirms that the bullet pulled from Adam Brower and the bullet pulled from the convenience store clerk came from the same gun , proving that the crimes are related .  Nick comes in and says that they found an abandoned vehicle off of I-93 that matches the description of the one that left the casino . When the get to the scene ,  Nick and Brass notice a single tire tread a short distance away , meaning that the getaway vehicle was a type of motorbike . When  Catherine and Grissom get the trunk of the abandoned car opened , they find  Tammy \\'s body inside .   Dr. Robbins finds signs that  Tammy was asphyxiated .  Catherine enters and correctly guesses that  Tammy did n\\'t put up a fight . When asked how  Catherine knows this ,  Catherine replies that  Catherine was killed by the one person  Catherine trusted in  Catherine life - Darin Hanson . Dr. Robbins says he called Tammy \\'s parents and that they sounded oddly relieved , with  Catherine noting that they finally know where  Tammy is .   When searching the car ,  Warrick finds dust that  Warrick notes was also found on Adam Brower \\'s clothes . Greg runs a test and finds that it is silica dust .  Grissom notes that there is an abandoned silica mine outside of  Cal-Nev-Ari - Nev - Ari . Grissom ,  Nick , and  Warrick head to the abandoned mine along with several police cars .  Grissom spots a motorbike outside of a port - a - john and notes that there were bike tracks at the dump site . When  Grissom opens the door , Darin Hanson is found shot execution style .  Nick finds a .45 caliber shell casing ;  Grissom notes that they are now out of suspects .   The whole group sans  Warrick runs down the case again with  Grissom concluding that Darin was the only one in the position to shoot Adam in the casino . Catherine confirms that Darin also strangled Tammy . It seems like Darin wanted the whole score to himself , but who shot him ? And why did they rob a convenience store for a few hundred dollars before stealing much more from a casino ? There are more questions than answers at this point .    Warrick arrives saying  Warrick got off the phone with the Laughlin CSI assigned to the casino robbery case the month before . That CSI claims there were four robbers in the casino , not three . When  Warrick goes through the surveillance videos again ,  Warrick and the rest of the team notice that the pit boss , Max Duncan , ducked for cover before  Tammy even drew  Tammy gun and fired at the chandelier . It turns out that  Max was also working in the Laughlin casino at the time  it was robbed . The team has found  it mole . Brass arrests  Max at  Max home while  Max \\'s packing  Max car to make an escape .  Catherine notices silica dust on  Max \\'s car .   Under interrogation ,  Max admits to helping the group plan the heist . Despite silica on  Max car , however ,  Max denies killing Darin .  Max claims that  Max went to the mine to collect  Max money , but Darin was already dead when he got there .  Catherine informs  Max that all parties are guilty of murder when it occurs during a felony ; Darin killed Adam , but  Max might as well have pulled the trigger .  Max \\'s attorney tries to make  deal , but when  Max ca n\\'t identify who shot Darin ,  deal deal is off the table .  Catherine remarks that there is still someone out there with a lot of cash .   In the AV lab ,  Archie is going over the still photos from the Laughlin heist .  Archie is able to break down the photo of the unknown suspect into segments and rebuild it . After rebuilding the photo ,  Sara recognizes the unknown suspect as the clerk from the convenience store .  Sara surmises that the clerk was shot way before the casino heist and the money stolen to make it look like a robbery .    Catherine and  Nick visit Bobby Dawson with the bullet taken from Darin \\'s head . Bobby confirms that  it is a .45 caliber bullet , but due to the grooves on the bullet ,  it was fired from a polygonal barrel . He is able to narrow the gun down to a Heckler & Koch . There are only 18 of that type of gun in the state of Nevada , with 10 of them registered in Clark County and seven of those still in circulation .  Catherine is familiar with a name on the list .   The name on the list was officer William Spencer . As they place him under arrest ,  Catherine gives  Catherine summation : William was driving on his daily route when he heard the gun fire with the potato silencer . As he went into the convenience store , he saw Darin and  Tammy robbing it . Instead of arresting them ,  Tammy bribed William with some of the stolen cash . When William wanted more , Darin told him that it would hold him over until the next day .

      "s05e12 ['Synopsis  Catherine and Nick investigate a case when a severed head containing a snake is found in a newspaper stand . Meanwhile , Greg , Sofia and Warrick investigate a shooting in a van .   Plot Victim : Veronica Juarez ( deceased )   On the case : Catherine Willows , Nick Stokes , Sam Vega   A newspaper delivery boy opens a newspaper dispenser and finds a bald , bloodied severed head . The dispenser is unscrewed from its post and brought to the lab . In autopsy ,  Catherine takes photos of the head and looks on in shock as Doc Robbins pulls a long , thin dead snake from the head \\'s mouth . Doc Robbins identifies the head as belonging to a Hispanic female in her early 30s and puts her time of death at roughly six hours before . Based on visuals , he tells  Catherine that both the decapitation and hair removal occurred postmortem . Doc Robbins removes some of the victim \\'s bridgework ; on the inside is a set of numbers . He tells  Catherine that dentists usually put some form of identification on removable bridgework .    Nick dusts the topmost newspaper in the dispenser for prints and is able to reveal some . However ,  Nick tells  Catherine that  they are palm prints and  they are likely not a good bet to help  they solve the case .  Catherine has  Nick run the prints , as well as run the partial prints from the dispenser itself . Herpetologist Jesse Menken tells  Nick that the snake recovered is a common rattlesnake indigenous to southern coastal Mexico .  Catherine adds that this type of snake is found in hot and humid places , and Vegas is hot and dry . The quick conclusion is that someone shoved the snake down the victim \\'s throat .   The serial number on the bridgework came back to a Veronica Juarez . In  Catherine apartment ,  they find a degree on the wall from the University of Texas El Paso , atypical of someone  they think is a gangbanger \\'s girlfriend .  Nick finds a digital camera that has pictures of  Catherine partying with a group of guys .  Catherine finds no evidence of sexual activity on  Catherine \\'s bed ; however , there is a bag of what looks to be pure crystal meth in  Catherine nightstand drawer . In the kitchen , Det .  Vega finds a poster of the band Extremo , who look like a mariachi band with artillery .  Vega tells Catherine and  Nick that , while working with the gang unit in Los Angeles ,  Vega frequently dealt with the Sinaloa cowboys , who happen to be big fans of this type of music .    Nick and Det .  Vega visit the club where Extremo is playing . They talk to the bartender , Juanito Concha , who identifies the victim as Carla , not  Catherine . The singer on stage sings a song in Spanish about a woman who cheated on him . The lyrics seem to line up with  Catherine \\'s murder , as they mention taking someone \\'s life and \" eating a snake . \" After the band comes off stage ,  Nick and  Vega try to talk to the lead singer , Rafael Salinas . However , the band \\'s manager steps in the way and answers questions on behalf of the band .  Nick asks about the song Rafael just sang and says that the lyrics are similar to  Catherine \\'s homicide ; however , the manager says that the song was written ten years ago . The manager is shown a picture of  Catherine and he , too , identifies  Catherine as  Carla . He says  Carla was a loyal fan that knew the lyrics to every one of Extremo \\'s songs .    Nick listens to some of Extremo \\'s songs and informs  Catherine that they are considered \" narcocorridos \" - a \" corrido \" is a Mexican ballad , while a \" narcocorrido \" is a drug ballad . He finds that the songs reference actual events , including specific dates and names . On the computer ,  Nick shows  Catherine an article written by Hilda C. Aguiar ; underneath the article is a photo of a head with a rattlesnake coming out of it . He explains that  Hilda was shacked up with a local drug lord and  Hilda ratted him out after  Hilda got dumped .  Hilda head was found , but the rest of the body was n\\'t . This seems to be life imitating art and anyone who knows the lyrics could be the killer .  Nick suddenly has a realization and shows  Catherine a newspaper from the dispenser . There is a story on the front page of the paper written by  Veronica .    Catherine and  Nick visit the newspaper Veronica was working for and  Catherine editor tells them that  Veronica was a freelancer working undercover .  Catherine piece on the narcocorridos was  Catherine first big story , and  Catherine figured that working undercover was the only way to get  Extremo to open up to  Catherine .  Veronica \\'s article came down pretty hard on the music since it glamorizes a criminal lifestyle . When asked if  Veronica received any threats , the editor tells  Catherine that there was one incident where  Vega man in a cowboy hat came into the office with a lit black candle chanting something in  Spanish .  Nick finds the candle in  Veronica \\'s drawer and it has a fingerprint on it . The candle is taken back to the lab for processing . There ,  Nick is able to find that the fingerprint is a match to Elindio Zapato , who owns a store in town .    Nick and Det .  Vega go to  Elindio \\'s store and find  Vega in the back of the store kneeling over dozens of black candles and chanting . In the store , there is something that looks like a shrine with another lit black candle ; there is a bone in the tray at the base of the candle . Further back in the store ,  Nick sees a clothing rack with various jackets . One of the jackets is a leather jacket with white fringe , very similar to the one  Veronica was wearing in the photos they found earlier .  Nick tells  Vega that  Nick has seen the jacket before ; however , this jacket has tire treads on the back of it .  Elindio is arrested and  Nick takes the jacket back to the lab for processing .   In the interrogation room ,  Elindio admits to going to the newspaper office to threaten  Veronica .  Elindio claims that the bone found in the shrine is a chicken bone , but  Nick says that it looks like a bone from a human finger and that it has been burned and that  Elindio \\'s going to run tests on it . Elindio knows nothing about  Veronica \\'s jacket , saying that someone gave it to  Elindio and that  Elindio does n\\'t know the person \\'s name , only their face .  Elindio claims to be a descendant of Jesus Malverde , a Mexican Robin Hood and folklore hero in the state of  Sinaloa . Det .  Elindio calls  Elindio a greedy fence and a disgrace to the community , but  Elindio says that what  Elindio does ,  Elindio does n\\'t do for money .    Catherine runs the tire treads from the back of  Veronica \\'s jacket and find that they match a large truck .  Nick looks closely at the pattern , notices that it is a retread , and says that there \\'s only one place in Vegas that specializes in retreads .  Catherine and  Nick visit the tire warehouse and speak to the manager , who tells them that they sell about 100 of those tires per month . While  Catherine and the manager research ,  Nick sees that one of the workers looks familiar . It \\'s Rafael Salinas , the lead singer for Extremo .  Catherine questions  Rafael , and  Catherine admits that  Catherine found out who  Veronica really was after  Catherine article came out .  Catherine says that  Catherine dumped  Veronica afterwards because  Veronica made it look like everyone involved in narcocorridos was a drug dealer or criminal .  Rafael tells  Catherine that  Veronica was a traitor and that people like that are n\\'t taken lightly in  Sinaloa .   The tire treads on the jacket are not a match to the tires on  Rafael \\'s truck and  Catherine palm prints do n\\'t match the ones found on the topmost newspaper in the dispenser .  Nick remembers that  Veronica was somewhere where there a lot of trucks with big tires .  Nick , Det .  Vega and some uniformed officers search the parking lot of the club where  Extremo is performing .  Nick finds the tires that match the treads from the jacket and they discover that the truck belongs to Juanito Concha , the club \\'s bartender . Juanito is found inside the club and  Nick notices that he \\'s wearing a belt that has human hair attached to it . After being handcuffed , Juanito tries to get away , which causes everyone there to draw their weapons .  Nick and Det .  Vega explain in  Spanish that Juanito killed an innocent woman and they are able to get  Nick out of the club without further incident .   In the interrogation room ,  Nick tells Juanito that he killed an innocent woman to impress people that do n\\'t care about him . Juanito insists that he \\'s going to become immortalized in history for what he \\'s done and that narcocorridos are going to be written about him . He starts to sing a narcocorrido about himself while a flashback shows Juanito in the desert with  Veronica \\'s body .  Elindio appears , decapitates  Veronica , and holds up one of  Elindio bones above a fire .   Victim : Vincent Decarlo ( deceased )   On the case : Greg Sanders , Sofia Curtis , Warrick Brown , Jim Brass   A man in a nice Italian suit is found shot to death in the driver \\'s seat of a handicap van . Brass finds $ 500 and a Nevada \\'s driver \\'s license on the victim ; the license identifies the victim as 28-year old Vincent Decarlo . There is a wheelchair in the back of the van , but there is no indication that Vincent is handicapped . There is a bullet hole in the windshield that  Sofia determines that the shot came from inside the van .  Warrick notices a blood spot in Vincent \\'s lapel inconsistent with the blood from the head wound and has David Phillips cut it out to avoid cross contamination . Gunshot residue on the back of the driver \\'s seat indicates that the shooter was in the wheelchair . They are looking for someone who fired a shot from a wheelchair and escaped on foot .   Doc Robbins finds fragments of a bullet in the the victim \\'s brain and tells  Sofia and Warrick that the right ear injury Vincent suffered is separate from the shot to the face . This finding , along with the bullet hole in the windshield , indicates that Vincent was shot twice . Doc Robbins tells  Warrick that all wheelchairs are registered with a medical supply company and that they have serial numbers . The wheelchair belongs to Bonnie Bakerset , a resident of a nursing home . The home \\'s manager tells Warrick and Brass that  Bonnie had passed away the week before and that  Bonnie had n\\'t left the premises in six months . They are shown  Bonnie \\'s room , which is full of boxes .  Warrick notes that most of the boxes have the same return address , and Brass guesses that telemarketers were targeting  Bonnie and selling  Bonnie all of this stuff . Outside , a few curious onlookers gather .  Brass gets  Brass names and asks about  Bonnie . One of the onlookers , Betsy Lewis , says that  Bonnie was lost after  Bonnie husband died , but a nice salesman would call and  they would talk for hours . The only thing  they know about  Bonnie \\'s wheelchair is that it was a gift from her grandson .    Sofia heads back to the scene to find more evidence , and  Greg arrives shortly thereafter to assist .  Sofia tells  Greg that if  they ca n\\'t find the bullet ,  they can find the shell casings .  Sofia hypothesis is that the shooter forced Vincent up to the roof at gunpoint since the area was deserted .  Sofia closes the back door , thinking that the shooter would have done the same thing to minimize sound . After borrowing a pen from  Greg ,  Sofia recreates the shooting and drops the pen cap . Since the killer had to open the back door to leave ,  Sofia does the same thing .  Greg watches the pen cap fall down into the van \\'s sliding door . After  Greg recovers the cap ,  Greg finds a shell casing from a 9 mm gun next to it .  Sofia has  Greg photograph the casing .    Sofia tells  Warrick that the blood on Vincent \\'s lapel came back to Dax Blanchard , who was in the system for assault and battery against a police officer . Among Vincent \\'s personal effects ,  Warrick finds some money and a script that a telemarketer must adhere to when cold calling .  Warrick calls Brass with this information and tells  Warrick that the company Vincent was working for was NZA ; the company \\'s address was on the side of  Bonnie \\'s boxes . Upon arriving at a very busy office ,  Warrick and Brass spot a leaderboard of top sellers with Vincent \\'s name at the top of the list .  Dax is in second place .  Dax speak to  Dax and see that he is holstering a gun .  Warrick checks the bullets and sees that they are 9 mm ;  Dax is brought to the station for questioning .   In interrogation ,  Dax is surprised when Brass tells him that Vincent is dead .  Dax says that the last time he saw Vincent was the morning before in the office ; there ,  Dax had an argument when Vincent sold something to  Dax \\'s grandmother . The two got in a fight with Vincent punching Dax , and  Dax spit blood onto Vincent \\'s lapel .  Dax says that his grandmother is confined to a wheelchair and living in a nursing home . Brass accuses of  him of murdering Vincent because of the scam and mentions Bonnie \\'s name . However ,  Dax says  him grandmother \\'s name is Fran and that she lives in Daytona Beach .    Sofia discovers that the 9 mm bullet is stamped with the letters DMW , standing for \" Deutsche waffen und munitions fabrik . \" It is an old World War II - era German bullet .  Sofia tells  Warrick that old bullets like this are trophies , enemy guns a soldier brings back from battle .  Warrick goes to the nursing home and speaks to  Bonnie \\'s neighbor , Stuart Manslow .  Warrick tells  Warrick that  Bonnie had Alzheimer \\'s and Vincent knew it . Vincent would call twice a day selling her something and , since  Bonnie had forgotten the earlier calls , she would order something else . Soon , everyone in the nursing home was getting a call from Vincent .  Stuart decided to play along and borrowed  Bonnie \\'s wheelchair .  Stuart told Vincent that he did n\\'t have a checking account and , after Vincent helped him open one in person , had him drive to the roof of the casino . There ,  Stuart shot Vincent twice , hitting only Vincent \\'s ear the first time because his hands were shaking .  Stuart tells  Warrick that in war , you knew who the enemy was . Now , it \\'s some young punk calling you on the phone and asking for your credit card number .  Stuart reluctantly hands  Stuart gun over to  Warrick .']\n",

      "s04e14 ['Synopsis The entire team investigates when a robbery at a grocery store turns into a shootout and mass murder , leaving five people dead , one of which is a police officer . The evidence leads  Grissom to doubt the story of the other police officer at the scene .   Plot Victim : Multiple victims ( deceased )   On the case : Entire team   A police car stops in front of the Best Bargain Supermarket . Officer David Fromansky gives rookie Officer Clay a list of items to purchase . As Officer Clay is picking up the last item , he sees the reflection of a masked gunman in the ceiling mirror in the next aisle . The officer is last seen drawing his weapon .    Catherine ,  Grissom and Warrick meet  Brass at the supermarket where Brass gives a summary of the carnage . There are five victims - two unidentified gunmen , a woman being wheeled into an ambulance outside , cocktail waitress Julia Reed , and cab driver Rufus Sanders .  Catherine snaps photos of Julia \\'s body , while Warrick does the same with Rufus . As  Grissom talks things over with Brass ,  Grissom notices blood drops leading under a table .  Grissom alerts  Brass ; when  they pull back the cloth ,  they find a little boy curled up in a ball , shivering , and suffering from a gunshot wound .    Grissom and  Brass talk to Officer Fromansky , who is sitting outside in the back of an ambulance . He recounts the events - while sitting in the police car , he heard gunshots and went inside . As he went to check on his partner , he came under heavy fire . When all was said and done , he had taken down three perpetrators , but is unsure of how many shots he fired in total . As Officer Fromansky walks away ,  Grissom and Brass are fully aware that they only found two masked gunmen in the store , despite being told that there were three .    Catherine has all of the workers and witnesses gathered in the back of the supermarket .  Catherine notices the husband of Julia Reed , and tells the uniformed officer with  Catherine that  Catherine \\'ll talk to him later .  Catherine interrogates the bag boy , who tells  Catherine that the gunmen made everyone go to the corner of the store and forced one of the workers , Celeste Turner , to open the registers at gunpoint . He then only remembers flashes and booms while he was huddled down looking at the floor .  Catherine wonders why the bag boy keeps looking behind him ; the bag boy shows  Catherine that he wet his pants during the encounter and wants to change .    Warrick and  Grissom look over the body of Officer Clay and surmise that the officer fired his weapon before completely removing it from its holster . While  Grissom and  Sara are processing different areas of the store ,  Nick talks to the store manager . The manager tells  Nick that the surveillance tapes only last 24 hours and that , due to budget restraints , they only have cameras on the registers and outside of the store .  Sara processes the body of Rufus Sanders , which has quarters on the floor around it .  Warrick notes that  Rufus had just won the $ 75 jackpot on one of the slot machines and was probably collecting  Rufus winnings when the robbery started .    Catherine speaks to one of the cashiers .  Catherine tells  Catherine that they all started running when Officer Fromansky entered the store and started firing at the robbers . The cashier , who was a casual acquaintance of  Rufus , saw  Rufus get shot and tried to apply pressure to  Rufus wound to save  Rufus ; however ,  Rufus was bleeding too much for  Catherine to stop it .  Catherine admits that  Catherine could n\\'t see Officer Fromansky from where  Catherine was in the store .    Warrick walks along the back of the store and checks out a bottle of empty drain cleaner with a bullet hole in it .  Warrick also observes the bullet holes in the refrigerator glass before meeting up with David Phillips . David is processing the body of Julia Reed , and he notes that there is an bullet entry wound but no exit wound . When  Julia \\'s body is flipped over ,  they find the bullet stuck in the skin on  Julia \\'s back .  Catherine interviews Julia \\'s husband , Trent .  Warrick tells  Catherine that  Julia \\'s heels prevented  Catherine from running . As  they tried running along the back of the store ,  Catherine was gunned down .   Doc Robbins is able to extract the bullet from  Julia without the use of tweezers , and he hands it over to  Warrick . Meanwhile ,  Grissom speaks with David in the morgue , where the bodies of Rufus and the two gunmen are laid out . David tells him that Officer Clay \\'s body has been processed and released to his family . David has gotten prints off of the two suspects and removed the bullets from their bodies , as well .  Grissom notices prison tattoos on both suspects and notes that this was n\\'t their first rodeo .    Catherine visits the hospital hoping to talk to Celeste Turner . A nurse tells  Catherine that  Celeste made it out of surgery and  Catherine hands  Catherine the bullets extracted from  Catherine .  Catherine asks about the boy Grissom and Brass found earlier , and  Catherine is told that the boy is Celeste \\'s son , Henry . Luckily , Henry only suffered minor wounds .   In the A / V lab ,  Nick shows  Catherine security camera footage of the robbery . It is revealed that one of the robbers was behind  Celeste the whole time , even when Officer Clay approached her to buy his groceries early on .  Catherine asks about the third mystery gunman , but  Nick tells  Catherine that all of the cars in the parking lot were accounted for and that the loading dock was empty .   There are a total of 18 bullets and 72 pellets that need to be processed . While Sara assists with that ,  Warrick reconstructs the crime scene via computer . Bobby Dawson interrupts him with some troubling news - there is no third gunman and the bullet that killed Julia Reed came from Officer Fromansky \\'s gun .  Grissom and Brass talk to the officer , who continues to maintain that  Grissom shot a third suspect .  Grissom points out that Julia was wearing black like the robbers and was carrying a purse that could have been mistaken for a gun . Officer Fromansky continues to maintain his innocence despite being told that his bullet was dug out of Julia .   At the hospital ,  Catherine speaks to a now lucid Celeste . Celeste says that she wanted to warn Officer Clay about the gunman , but could n\\'t . She tells  Catherine that she \\'s not allowed to bring her son to work ; however , her ex - boyfriend dropped him off unexpectedly . She hid  Henry in the manager \\'s office but could n\\'t find  Henry when the gunfire started . She was shot as she was running from the office looking for  Henry .    Nick has two lab techs count all of the money that was found on the robbers .  Nick then shows  Catherine that when a cash register reaches a preset amount , a light ( or \" halo \" ) goes off letting the manager know it \\'s time to transfer the cash to the safe . However , the security footage shows most of the halos lit , showing that the robbers knew the exact time to rob the store .    Grissom has the crime scene photos laid out on a table as Doc Robbins recaps the causes of death for all victims .  Catherine looks closely at the photo of Julia Reed \\'s body and is perplexed .  Catherine speaks with Mr. Reed again in order to clarify his story . Mr. Reed had said his wife has fallen while they were running ; however , there were scrapes or bruises on her elbows or knees . He soon remembers that  Julia was running along the back of the store when  Julia froze up , unable to move .    Grissom meets up with  Warrick and looks at the digital reconstruction of the crime scene . They find that Officer Fromansky was telling the truth , as  Grissom had fired four shots at the back of the store . Officer Fromansky is seen talking to Internal Affairs with  Grissom and Brass watching from the outside . He says he had an unobstructed view of the back of the store ; however , he can not explain why one of his bullets killed Julia Reed .  Grissom wonders if the officer really does n\\'t know what happened .    Grissom and  Warrick go back to the store and recreate the crime scene using mannequins and lasers .  Grissom finds that the cracks from one of the bullet holes in the refrigerator glass terminated when it came in contact with another bullet hole . Thus , their sequence is out of order . It seems that Officer Fromansky was shooting from left to right at a moving target . They look around and find that the exit door was in that direction , and the door leads to the loading dock .  Warrick tells  Grissom that the security camera out there did n\\'t pick anything up before , during , or after the robbery ; however ,  Grissom wonders if that is n\\'t the whole story . Inside ,  Grissom watches the security footage while  Warrick stands outside .  Warrick takes some steps to  Warrick left until  Warrick is out of the frame . There ,  Warrick finds paint transfer on a wall and skid marks indicating a getaway .    Warrick relays this information to  Catherine and  Nick and notes that both the paint transfer and skid marks were recent . It appears that the robbers knew of the blind spot in the loading dock leading  Catherine to guess that the whole thing was an inside job .  Nick agrees saying that , when all of the money from the registers was counted up and matched against the receipts , there was $ 878 missing .  Nick says  Nick \\'ll check out the employees to see if any of them have a record .   David Hodges runs the paint chips and discovers that they came from an Aegean blue  Honda Accord made between 1984 and 1987 . Officers are able to locate the car , which  Brass tells  Warrick was reported stolen three weeks before .  Warrick tests the front passenger \\'s seat and it comes back positive for an acid , which  Warrick guesses is sodium hydroxide from the empty bottle of drain cleaner  Warrick found earlier .  Warrick is also able to lift a print from the car \\'s busted ignition lock . Meanwhile ,  Brass finds a cell phone in the back seat ; it \\'s call history has the same number listed three times .  Brass calls the number listed and discovers that it \\'s the number for the supermarket . Someone at the store was eager to talk to the robbers .   The print on the ignition lock belongs to Todd Hallickey . Todd , who is out on parole , is brought in for questioning , where he tells  Brass that he does n\\'t steal cars anymore . His story is that he was looking to buy a car and test drove the blue  Honda Accord in question .  Brass notices chemical burns on  Todd \\'s hands and figures they came from the drain cleaner . Meanwhile ,  Warrick looks over the clothes confiscated from  Todd \\'s apartment and finds a bullet hole in a jacket that tests positive for lead . All of this puts  Todd at the scene .    Catherine ,  Grissom and  Warrick sit in the break room recapping the case .  Warrick says that  Todd had no connection to the grocery store , while  Grissom points out that a bullet hole in a jacket is n\\'t even enough to place  Todd in the store . The missing $ 878 was n\\'t found in  Todd \\'s apartment , either .  Grissom wonders about the calls from the cell phone to the store , but  Warrick tells  Warrick that the store runs off of a system where every call goes to the same number . In other words , any employee could have been on the other end of the call .  Nick enters and says that one of the employees , Raul Valdez , had a criminal record .  Nick also clocked into work on the day of the robbery , but  Nick never clocked out .  Catherine remarks that nobody by the name of Raul Valdez was interviewed at the scene .  Nick adds that Raul had served time in the same prison the robbers did .    Catherine goes back to the store .  Catherine walks along the back of it while looking at a crime scene photo of a bag of money .  Catherine finds the spot where the bag boy soiled himself , then looks at the display of cereal boxes .  Catherine sees that one of the boxes is turned on its side .  Catherine looks inside this box and discovers the missing money .  Catherine interrogates the bag boy , and  Catherine admits to hiding the money in the box .  Catherine figured  Catherine earned the money due to  Catherine meager pay and dealing with the pain and suffering of the robbery .  Catherine accuses  Catherine of setting up the robbery , but  Catherine vehemently denies this , only admitting to hiding the money .    Grissom looks at the bullet pulled from Julia Reed under a microscope .  Grissom finds polyester attached to the bullet ;  Warrick tells  Grissom that  Julia was only wearing a wool sweater . However , the jacket taken from Todd Hallickey \\'s apartment was polyester .  Grissom notes that Officer Fromansky was tunnel - visioned on the gunman and that he never saw  Julia . A flashback shows Officer Fromansky firing from left to right at the gunman (  Todd ) .  Todd ran in front of Julia , who was standing frozen against the refrigerator glass . One bullet went through  Todd jacket and hit Julia , who Officer Fromansky never saw standing there .    Nick shows  Catherine security footage from the loading dock , where  Nick finds that someone manually moved the camera two nights before , creating a blind spot . The print on the camera belongs to Celeste Turner , and it is revealed that she orchestrated the robbery . However , she tried to call it off when her ex dropped her son off at the store . Celeste says that she had worked at the store for five years , but her manager would n\\'t give her enough hours for her to qualify for benefits . She admits that nobody was supposed to get hurt .   Officer Fromansky is shown getting a commendation from the mayor \\'s office , and  Brass asks  Grissom what he thinks about that .  Grissom notes that there are two dead felons , two dead civilians , and a dead police officer .  Grissom does n\\'t know what to think .']\n",
      "s04e06 [\"Synopsis When Dr. Robbins receives a severed head found by a dog ,  Grissom goes to Jackpot , Nevada in search of the rest of the body . When he arrives he soon finds out that he can not expect much help from the locals . Even the sheriff seems to be hiding something . Meanwhile  Catherine gets an unexpected gift from  Catherine father .   Plot Victim : Ross Jenson ( deceased )   On the case : Catherine Willows , Gil Grissom , Jim Brass   There is a package in the morgue addressed to Doc Robbins . When he opens it , he finds a severed human head inside . The head smells of formaldehyde , which  Grissom notes destroys DNA . There is heavy decomposition , meaning time of death will be difficult to decipher . There is a knife cut on the left cheek , which  Grissom says took some skill . As David Hodges helps Doc Robbins clean debris off of the head ,  Catherine enters the morgue .  Catherine sees that the package the doc received is from Jackpot , a Nevada town  Catherine has never heard of before .    Grissom drives out to the remote town of Jackpot , where  Grissom speaks to Lieutenant Alan Brooks and  Grissom brother Leland . Neither of them match  Grissom 's level of interest in the case , with Leland believing the body to belong to a transient or to a hiker who got lost . Lt . Brooks tells  Grissom that nobody in the community has been reported missing and that  Grissom does n't have the resources to go looking for a body .  Grissom informs  them that  them not only have the head , but that it has a knife wound on it , meaning that  them are looking for a body and a killer .   In the lab , Hodges informs  Catherine that due to the plant life gathered from the head , it was likely on a damp , north - facing slope at least 9,000 feet up and not recently exposed to a forest fire .  Catherine calls  Grissom with this information .  Grissom then speaks to Sylvia Rogers , whose dog found the head .  Grissom tells  Catherine that if an animal brings back a body part , there is a good chance that the rest of the body is within a half mile radius .  Catherine tells  Grissom that  Catherine frequently sees buzzards and vultures in the area . Next to Sylvia 's house , there is a north - facing hill and Grissom ,  Lt .  Brooks , and other officers search it . While  Lt .  Brooks complains about the many minor crimes that happen in Jackpot , an officer finds a buried headless body . Based on the insect activity ,  Grissom estimates that the body has been there for about 4 - 7 days .  Grissom also believes that the victim was buried alive up to  Grissom neck , with the cut on the neck being used to attract wild animals . Blood spatter indicates that the victim was alive when he was attacked .    Lt .  Brooks continues to get agitated as  Grissom insists on following procedures . Dr. Dale Sterling , the town medical professional ( who also happens to be the veterinarian ) allows the body to be released and brought back to the office . As they look over the body ( they do not have credentials to perform an autopsy ) , Dr. Sterling tells  Grissom he is unable to find a wallet or form of identification .  Grissom pulls a ball of paper from the victim 's pocket and mentions that there are no ligature marks present , meaning that the victim was n't tied up . They all speculate as to how that could happen - Dr. Sterling wonders if the murderer had a gun , but  Lt .  Brooks insists that there was more than one killer , since one could n't dig a hole and hold a gun at the same time . Dr. Sterling also hypothesizes that the hole was dug earlier , which would indicate premeditation .  Grissom remembers that  Sylvia 's dog got sick after chewing on the head , meaning that the victim may have been drugged . Dr. Sterling had sent the dog 's blood work to Reno and  Grissom asks  Grissom to call them and get a rush on the results .   After one of the officers leaves to drive the body to Doc Robbins , Lt .  Brooks and another officer retire for the night . Dr. Sterling gets  Grissom a place to work . As  Grissom is working on the ball of  paper to slowly get unraveled ,  Grissom hears a noise and gets  Grissom gun out . The results of  paper paper are sent to the Vegas lab , where  Catherine tells Grissom that  paper paper was a receipt from the WLVU bookstore .  Catherine looks over the receipt and sees that most of the books are for freshmen classes . There is also a book listed for a sophomore - level fine arts class . A freshman taking a sophomore level course narrows their search field .   It is discovered that the victim is Ross Jenson . Brass questions his roommate , who says he had n't seen  Ross in a week and did n't find that odd since  Ross was an art student . As  Catherine looks around the room ,  Catherine finds dirt and leaf evidence that indicates  Ross was in the countryside . The roommate confirms that  Ross liked the scenery and traveled there frequently .   Back in Jackpot , Grissom ( who had fallen asleep holding  his gun ) receives the fax identifying  his victim .  his speaks to Doris , the waitress at the diner  his visited earlier .  Catherine recalls seeing  Ross the week before when  his came to the diner and  Catherine and flirted with  his for just a bit . A diner patron says that he remembers  Ross driving a black or blue car best suited for the city and not the mountains . Grissom speaks to Lt . Brooks , who takes offense when Grissom says that the killer could be a local . Working on this theory , Grissom says that the car could be hidden somewhere in town and that  Ross could have been abducted on his way out of town along the main highway .   As he is driving along the highway , Grissom spots tire tracks heading up an embankment and gets out of his car . He locks the car and follows the tracks , coming across the spot where  Ross 's body was found . As he continues to follow the tracks , he spots a barn in the distance . Grissom hops a fence and peeks through the barn 's doors , finding  Ross 's car inside . With the barn doors locked , he walks around to the side and opens one of the windows . He finds an old screen on the barn floor , indicating that this is how the killer got out . Just then , Grissom 's car alarm goes off . He walks back to the car to discover the passenger 's side window smashed and his field kit stolen .   Grissom informs Lt .  Brooks about the break - in and theft . He then goes to the convenience store and buys a battery , a box of storage bags , refillable pencil lead , blank index cards , and tape . As an unhelpful Lt .  Brooks looks on , Grissom tells  Brooks that found  Ross 's car in the barn and notified highway patrol in order to help secure the site . Using some of the supplies he bought as well as tinting film he got from Dr. Sterling , Grissom is able to lift a shoe print from the screen on the barn 's floor . Inside of  Ross 's car , he finds a thermos and some hairs in  Ross 's shirts . He also lifts a fingerprint from the steering wheel using more of the supplies he purchased .  Lt .  Brooks shows up and continues to antagonize Grissom while leaning up against the rail of a fence . When pressed ,  Brooks reveals that the person looking after the land is Marty Cooperman , who owns the local gas station . After  Lt .  Brooks leaves , Grissom lifts  Brooks fingerprints from the rail .   Grissom visits the gas station and speaks to  Marty , who acts surprised when told that  Ross 's car was found in his uncle 's old barn . Since the car was full of gas , Grissom knows  Ross stopped by the station and filled up the tank .  Marty starts acting suspiciously and tells Grissom he can fix the broken car window to help Grissom get back home , which he should do .  Catherine calls Grissom and tells him that Greg discovered a series of romantic messages from  Ross 's computer to someone in Jackpot . Brass is working on getting the receiver 's name . Meanwhile ,  Catherine receives an envelope that has the Rampart Casino logo stamped on it . It is a letter and a check from Sam Braun for $ 250,000 .   Grissom is comparing fingerprints in Dr. Sterling 's office when the doc tells him that the blood work from  Sylvia 's dog tested positive for GHB . Grissom says that it could have been used as a sedative on  Ross . Under the microscope , Dr. Sterling examines the hair found on  Ross 's shirt and says it is from an Abyssinian cat . Grissom asks him if any of his patients are Abyssinian and the doc hands him a picture of the cat being held by  Brooks Brooks .   Grissom visits Lt .  Brooks and relays the information he has found in the case -  Ross 's relationship with someone in Jackpot who owns an Abyssinian cat . When he asks if  Leland is gay ,  Lt .  Brooks responds that that is none of Grissom 's business . Grissom reluctantly goes for a ride with Lt .  Brooks to  Leland 's house . As the lieutenant goes inside the house to speak to his brother ,  Grissom looks around the area , where  Grissom finds fresh tire tracks as well as the cat . Just then , a gunshot breaks a window . Grissom looks in the house , where  Lt .  Brooks is wrestling a rifle away from Leland , who had tried to kill himself .  Leland collapses on  Leland couch crying .   The next day , Grissom speaks to  Lt . Brooks , who indicates that  Leland will be held in custody until  Leland 's ready to go home . An incredulous Grissom says that he was shot at and that  Leland tried to kill  Leland , but the lieutenant simply says that his brother has always had a temper . Meanwhile ,  Catherine pays Sam Braun a visit on his ranch .  Catherine is enraged that he sent  Catherine the check , but Sam says that he did n't do right by his sons or Catherine 's mother ; he just wanted to provide for his daughter and granddaughter . In the station locker room ,  Catherine considers ripping up the check , but has second thoughts .   After a discovery from Greg ,  Catherine calls  Grissom and tells  Grissom that  Ross had used Mapquest to drive up to Jackpot . There seems to be an inconsistency , as  Ross had been in a relationship with someone from Jackpot for months and leaves were found in  Grissom dorm room . However ,  Ross had a roommate , who is revealed to be Eric Brooks , the son of  Leland .    Catherine and Brass interrogate Eric , who insists that  his father was n't gay .  his also does n't know if  Ross was . Brass tells  Eric that  Ross 's car was found ditched in a barn with  Grissom fingerprints on the steering wheel .  Eric explains that  Eric sometimes borrowed  Ross 's car because  Eric owns a motorcycle . A flashback shows the single tire track  Grissom found outside of  Leland 's house .  Catherine asks to look at  Eric 's shoes , and the shoe print matches the one Grissom lifted from the barn .   A flashback shows  Eric riding his motorcycle up to Jackpot and finding  Ross 's car at his father 's house . Inside ,  Leland and  Ross are sharing an evening .  Leland took  Ross 's GHB vial , poured into the thermos , and trailed  Ross for the evening until  Leland passed out from the drugs .  Eric then took  Ross 's body and buried it . When asked why  Eric did n't just kill  Ross himself ,  Eric says that  Ross wanted  Ross to suffer .  Catherine asks  Eric if  Eric was mad that  Ross was in love with  Ross father or that  Ross was mad that  Ross was n't in love with  Ross .  Catherine gets no response .   Back in Jackpot , Grissom speaks to  Lt .  Brooks one last time . The lieutentant admits that he recognized  Ross 's shirt when he was buried in the hole and started protecting his brother , as he thought  Leland could have been the murderer . As Grissom leaves ,  Leland notices  Leland field kit back in the backseat .  Leland smiles at  Lt .  Brooks then sets out to drive back to Vegas .\"]\n",
      "s04e09 ['Synopsis When the new sheriff is witness to a car bombing that kills an air marshal and two others , he puts pressure on Grissom to find the murderer .  Nick puts the bomb back together , finding out it was a pipe bomb connected to to a timer in the dash board . Remains of the bomb lead Grissom ,  Catherine and  Nick to a high school science fair . Meanwhile Warrick and Sara look into the death of the wife of a popular singer .   Plot Victim : Adam Watson ( deceased )   On the case : Catherine Willows , Gil Grissom , Nick Stokes , Jim Brass   Outside of the Orpheus hotel , a valet goes to get a bag out of the trunk of a car when the car explodes , killing him and the driver . Among the witnesses is Sheriff Rory Atwater , who was just leaving the hotel .  Catherine and  Grissom arrive and , as they go over the events with the sheriff , gunshots start ringing out causing everyone to take cover .   After the shots cease and the CSIs examine the crime scene ,  Grissom sees that the bag in the trunk had  bullets in it . The heat from the explosion ignited the gunpowder , causing  bullets bullets to explode . As  Grissom looks over the car ,  Grissom finds the driver \\'s feet still on the floor in front of the seat . The VIN number is attached to the car .  Catherine is placing evidence markers all around and finds a melted gun that  Catherine presumes belonged to the driver .  Nick arrives and offers to start bagging evidence and separating out the bomb components .   In the CSI garage , an eager  Greg offers to help  Grissom examine the car .  Grissom tells  Grissom that  Grissom found that the bomb was attached to the gas tank and asks  Greg to find the initiation switch . Under the car ,  Greg finds a stray wire that leads to the center of the dashboard .  Grissom surmises that the digital clock in the car was the switch and that it was time - activated . Meanwhile ,  Nick separates out the parts of the bomb and deduces that it was a pipe bomb initiated by a light bulb filament . Concerned that  Grissom has nothing to go to the press with , Sheriff Atwater asks  Grissom for information about the bomber and his / her motive .  Grissom replies that they \\'re only learning about the bomb and that there is nothing distinctive about it like a signature .   Bobby Dawson tells  Catherine that the melted gun  Catherine found was nondescript . There was a blue substance on it that  Grissom thinks was from a bag that melted in the explosion and  Grissom sent a sample of it to Trace . However ,  Grissom informs  Catherine that the bullets from the trunk of the car are unique - they are designed to enter a target but not exit it .  Grissom concludes that the victim of the explosion is likely a Federal Air Marshal , as these are the types of bullets that would be used on an airplane if it was being hijacked .    Brass speaks to the manager of the place the car was rented from . The manager confirms that the car was rented to Adam Watson , who was irate when he could n\\'t rent a compact car and flashed his air marshal badge to the manager .  Adam chose the Camaro ; the manager tells  Brass that the car arrived on the lot at 9:31 PM and  Adam drove it out nine minutes later .  Brass relays this information to  Grissom , but  Grissom is puzzled . The bomb went off thirty minutes after  Adam drove the car off the lot and it takes a lot longer than that to hard - wire a bomb .  They guess that the bomb was already in the car when it was returned to the rental place , meaning that  They need to find out who rented the car before  Adam .   It is found that the previous renter of the Camaro was Roger Dunbar . Brass and some uniformed officers break down the door to  Roger \\'s apartment , but find nobody inside . The interior is barely decorated , with only an air mattress on the floor .  Catherine and  Grissom enter the house ;  Catherine finds a paper shredder with shreds inside , while  Grissom collects a bloody band - aid from one of the garbage cans . There appear to be no signs of bomb - making materials . As  Catherine examines some magazines on a table ,  Catherine notices writing on one of the covers .  Catherine dusts the cover and sees that the writing reads \" Dr. Amerian , 4:00 PM \" and that the date is today .    Roger is found and brought in for questioning , upset that  Roger was pulled out of  Roger dentist \\'s office and accused of planting a car bomb . After a few questions ,  Roger refuses to answer further without an attorney present .  Catherine has  Roger remove  Roger clothes as evidence . Meanwhile ,  Nick discovers that the explosive used was ammonium perchlorate ( rocket fuel ) and the GCMS identified the other half as gasoline .  Nick points out to  Grissom that ammonium perchlorate can be purchased at any chemical supply store , so this does n\\'t necessarily narrow down the list of suspects . Sheriff Atwater interrupts with a few questions , one of which asks why a bomb tied to a digital clock would go off at the wrong time .  Nick shows him that there was a fray in the wire , which would cause the bomb to go off at any time making it unpredictable .   Lab results show that  Roger had rocket fuel on  Roger t - shirt . When questioned about this ,  Roger tells  Catherine and Brass that  Grissom was helping  Grissom son , Timmy , with a science project for Mesquite Elementary School ;  Grissom built a volcano and some of the chemicals spilled onto  Grissom shirt . There is still visible confusion about  Grissom apartment , and  Roger explains that  Grissom needs  Grissom space from  Grissom family , so  Grissom rents an apartment and tells them that  Grissom is out of town on business .  Catherine and Brass get  Roger \\'s \" real \" home address and  Catherine and  Grissom pay his family a visit . Inside the Dunbar house , they find a model volcano on the dining room table along with three chemicals , one of which is ammonium perchlorate .  Catherine questions  Roger \\'s wife , Beth , who says that  Roger is largely inept and did n\\'t help build the volcano .  Beth informs  Catherine that  Roger works for the state department and once accidentally revealed that  Roger actually worked for the CIA .    Grissom brings the model volcano back to the lab as evidence . Nick tells  Grissom that the tool marks on the bomb \\'s end cap are consistent with pliers or a vice grip ; however , there was no vice grip present in the Dunbar \\'s toolbox .  Grissom removes the end cap used in the volcano and compares it with the bomb \\'s end cap ; the tool marks are completely different , meaning that the tool used to build the bomb was not used in the volcano .    Catherine speaks to Ronnie Litre about the paper shreds found in  Roger \\'s secret apartment . There are five bills laid out on the table and two of them are credit card bills . However , one of the bills is addressed to Roger A. Dunbar , while the other is for Roger B. Dunbar . There are three different gas bills - one for the apartment , one for his house in Mesquite , and another for a house in  Henderson .  Greg interrupts and informs  Catherine that the blood found on the band - aid in  Roger \\'s apartment came back as female with seven alleles in common with  Roger , indicating a relative . Since  Catherine was told that  Roger \\'s parents are deceased and that  he is an only child ,  this means  he has a daughter .  this appears  he \\'s living a secret life with a family in  Henderson .    Catherine and Grissom pay Debbie Dunbar a visit .  Catherine shows  Catherine a photo of  Roger and  Debbie confirms that  Roger is  Catherine husband . They tell  Debbie that  Roger is in police custody , which is why  Roger has not been in contact with  Debbie recently .  Grissom asks  Debbie if  Debbie has a daughter ;  Debbie replies that her name is Amy . Inside the house , they find a model volcano identical to the one they found in the other house .  Debbie tells Catherine and  Grissom that  Roger built the volcano and used the pair of vice grips that they discovered .   Under interrogation ,  Roger admits to having two wives , saying  Roger spends the weekdays with  Debbie and  Amy and the weekends with  Beth and Timmy .  Roger rented the apartment to give  Roger a little personal time every once in a while , and tells  Catherine and Brass that  Amy had given  Roger the bloody band - aid to throw away and  Roger did so in the apartment . When pressed ,  Roger admits to borrowing pliers from  Beth \\'s house in  Mesquite and using them to build  Amy \\'s volcano in  Henderson , knowing how to do so after watching  Beth build the first one .  Roger realizes  Roger messed up when  Roger remembers that  Roger never returned the pliers to  Beth in  Mesquite .    Catherine goes to  Beth \\'s house and lines up the tool marks from the bomb with the tool marks left on a garden hose pipe that  Catherine had fixed the week before .  Beth is arrested and brought in for questioning . In interrogation ,  Beth admits to  Catherine and  Grissom that  Beth suspected  Roger was seeing another woman . However ,  Beth snapped when  Beth realized  Roger actually had a whole other family .  Beth built the bomb and put it in the rental car , admitting that it was supposed to go off at 8:30 PM when  Roger was on  Roger way to the airport . However , it went off later and killed three innocent people .  Grissom asks  Beth why  Beth chose a bomb as the murder weapon ;  Beth replies that it \\'s not much harder to build a bomb than it is to build a volcano .   Victim : Amelia Reuben ( deceased )   On the case : Sara Sidle , Warrick Brown , Louis Vartann    Sara and Warrick are called to a hotel room where Amelia Reuben , the wife of famous singer Myles Reuben , is found lying face down in a bubbling hot tub .  Sara discovers a wine glass in the tub , while  Warrick finds an almost empty wine bottle on a table .  Sara wonders whether the wine made  Amelia too relaxed causing  Sara to drown . Doc Robbins arrives and puts the time of death at less than an hour ago . Meanwhile ,  Sara lifts fingerprints from the hot tub buttons . They speak to  Myles \\'s manager , Sam Hopkins , who wants to be the one to relay the news to  Myles . When he is unable to do so ,  Sara breaks the news instead .   In autopsy , Doc Robbins tells  Sara and Warrick that  Amelia did n\\'t die from drowning , but from cardiac arrest .  Warrick finds this odd , as  Amelia was only 25 years old . The doc confirms that  Amelia \\'s heart was in perfect condition and says that he ca n\\'t explain why this happened to  Sara .  Sara runs the prints recovered from the hot tub buttons and finds that they come back to Sam Hopkins . As  Sara and  Warrick wonder what Sam was doing in the room ,  Greg interrupts and tells them that hydroflouric acid was found in  Amelia \\'s system -  Sara was poisoned .    Sara and  Warrick go to speak to Sam . He tells them that he is n\\'t only Myles \\'s manager , but also his marriage counselor and confidant , too . He kept  Myles happy by keeping  Amelia happy . A flashback shows Sam in the hotel room while  Amelia laid in the hot tub with tears running down  Amelia face . Sam offers to set up a dinner for the two of  them , turns a dial on the hot tub , and leaves . In the present , Sam tells  them that he does anything  Myles asks him to and is surprised when told that  Amelia was poisoned .    Greg pages  Warrick and tells him that he discovered that  Amelia \\'s wine had been spiked with the hydroflouric acid .  Sara and  Warrick question the room service waiter who was responsible for bringing  Amelia the wine . He confirms that there was nobody else in the hotel room the night  Amelia died ; the only person that came in was  Myles , and he promptly showed the waiter the door . The waiter tells  Sara and Warrick that  Amelia would call him up to the room several times per night , leading the waiter to think that she was lonely .    Sara and  Warrick search  Myles \\'s residence where they end up finding a bottle of glass cleaner that contains hydroflouric acid as an ingredient . Along with Det .  Vartann , they interrogate  Myles .  Vartann recognizes the glass cleaner and says that  Vartann used it to clean  Vartann windows .  Vartann would write music late at night and would use the windows as  Vartann chalkboard , wiping away the writing with the glass cleaner and a towel .  Myles is surprised that  Amelia was poisoned , as  Myles says  Myles was present when the bottle of wine was opened .  Myles admits to loving  Myles wife passionately , but says that they fought almost every night because she knew she could n\\'t have  Myles to herself due to  Myles popularity .   After  Myles leaves to go perform a sound check for  Myles show ,  Sara ,  Warrick and  Vartann sum up what they have in the case . Three people admitted to being with  Amelia the night she died - Myles , his manager , Sam , and the room service waiter .  Vartann rules out the room service waiter , as  Vartann had left the room before the wine was opened . This leaves  Sara to wonder if  Myles killed  Myles wife and Sam is covering for  Myles or whether Sam killed  Amelia and  Myles does n\\'t know about it .   In the lab ,  Warrick looks over rubber gloves found in  Myles \\'s residence and sees three burn marks on one of them .  Sara walks in and tells  Warrick that  Sara recovered fingerprints from the bottle of glass cleaner and that they belong to  Amelia . They pay Doc Robbins a visit and  Warrick observes that there are three burn marks on  Amelia \\'s right hand . The conclude that  Amelia wore the rubber gloves , poured the glass cleaner into the wine , got in the hot tub , and committed suicide .  Warrick relays this information to Myles , who blames  himself and admits that  himself spent more time making  himself fans happy than  himself did making  himself wife happy .']\n",
      "s04e10 ['ynopsis Grissom , Sara and Warrick investigate when a 15-year - old boy is found beaten to death with a hammer at a construction site . Meanwhile , Nick and Catherine try to find out how a woman was killed by a gunshot in her front yard while her husband and ex - husband were arguing over her .   Plot Victim : Brian Haddick ( deceased )   On the case : Gil Grissom , Sara Sidle , Warrick Brown , Jim Brass   At a construction site , the body of a teenage boy is found in the middle of an empty room . He is lying face down with his pants pulled down to his knees , and there is blood spatter over all of the walls .  Grissom arrives on the scene ; Brass tells him that the victim has no ID on him and that the coroner said he has been dead for over 12 hours .  Grissom notices that the victim is clutching something red in  Grissom left hand .    Sara and Warrick arrive on the scene while Brass talks to the foreman , who is complaining that teenagers like to use the construction site as their personal hangout spot . They look at the victim \\'s body and see blunt force trauma in the shape of what appears to be the head of a hammer .  Sara is tasked with checking every construction worker \\'s hammer for blood . As  Grissom photographs the scene ,  Warrick pushes the victim \\'s jacket aside and finds a bloody shoe print .    Grissom extracts the piece of red cloth from the victim \\'s hand and hands it to a uniformed officer . The officer lets a scent dog smell the cloth and track the scent \\'s origin . With  Sara in tow , the dog follows the trail through the neighborhood to a mall , then through the mall and outside to a dumpster . The dog reacts when  Sara picks up a shopping bag from the dumpster . In the bag is a red sweater along with receipts for clothes , earrings , and an iced cappuccino . It would appear that they are looking for a female suspect .   In the lab ,  Warrick tests all of the workers \\' hammers for blood and one them comes up positive . The hammer belongs to a Gregory Curtwell . Meanwhile ,  Sara meets up with Archie and looks over the security camera footage from the dressing room based on the time and location on the receipt found in the dumpster .  They are able to locate the girl wearing the red sweater ; it seems that  Sara did a \" walk out , \" ripping the tags off of the sweater , then walking out while wearing it .  Sara says that despite having the girl \\'s face on camera ,  They might not have much to go on since  Sara looks like  Sara \\'s a minor and  Sara paid in cash .    Warrick and Brass interrogate Gregory , who has cuts on  his hands and a bandage on  his nose .  his says that the injuries are from working in construction . Gregory also tells them he never leaves his hammer at the job site and is surprised to learn that the victim \\'s blood was on it . He is unable to identify the victim from his photo , but recognizes the girl from the mall security footage as his younger sister ,  Ashley .    Ashley is brought in for questioning .  Ashley tells  Sara that  Ashley was going to the mall to get something to eat and  Ashley cut through the construction site . There ,  Ashley ran into a classmate , Brian Haddick , who used the story of a missing cat to get  Ashley alone and rape  Ashley . While this was going on , someone came in and hit  Brian over the head with a hammer , allowing  Ashley to escape .  Ashley went to the mall and bought new clothes , but tells  Sara that  Ashley does n\\'t remember buying earrings or something to drink .  Ashley claims that  Ashley does n\\'t know who hit  Brian . Warrick and Brass are watching from behind the glass , and both think that  Ashley is covering for  Ashley brother .   In autopsy , Doc Robbins tells  Grissom that whoever hit  Brian kept hitting  Grissom , eventually severing part of  Grissom spinal cord . The doc concludes that  Brian was beaten after  Brian was already dead . Abrasions on one of his hands show that he may have gotten a punch in , and blood and skin transfers were sent to  Greg . Meanwhile ,  Grissom talks to  Brian \\'s parents , and they positively ID their son . However , they do not recognize  Ashley from the security camera photo . Mr. and Mrs. Haddick tell  Grissom that  Brian went through a \" rough patch , \" but got out of it and was earning $ 500 every two weeks busing and waiting on tables in a restaurant .    Greg informs Warrick that , based on the DNA evidence , Gregory did not murder  Brian . Grissom ,  Sara and Warrick revisit the crime scene . Based on the blood evidence , they conclude that  Brian was hit while standing up , then hit multiple times as  Brian was crawling . There is blood castoff on the other walls , leading  Sara to ask why that is .  Sara says that  assailants tend to move in reaction to  assailants target , but  Brian was immobile due to the severed spinal cord .  Grissom guesses that all of the castoff would be possible if there were three attackers and three hammers .    Warrick tells  Grissom and Brass that the bloody shoe print at the crime scene is a size 11 and that it belongs to a skate shoe . This points in the direction of a teenager , not a construction worker . Both Ashley and  Brian were students at McKinley High School , so  Grissom ,  Warrick and Brass head to the school to see if they can find the shoe that matches the print . The students are brought together in the gym , but this quickly ends when one of the student \\'s fathers says that he \\'s a lawyer and that the kids can not be questioned without a parent or guardian present . After most of the students file out ,  Warrick notices  blood on one of the shoes of a student that stayed behind .   The student is Benny Lizzio , and  Warrick and Brass pay the Lizzio residence a visit . While there and in the presence of Mr. Lizzio ,  Warrick tests  blood blood on  Benny \\'s shoe and finds that it matches Brian Haddick \\'s blood . When questioned ,  Benny says  Benny sometimes hangs out at the construction site .  Benny came across  Brian \\'s body and stepped in the blood ;  Benny did n\\'t report anything because  Benny was trespassing . With permission ,  Warrick searches  Benny \\'s room and finds smashed watermelons on the floor along with a hammer . It seems that  Benny was working on  Benny technique before doing the real thing .    Benny is brought in for questioning , where  Benny admits to Brass that  Benny knew  Brian , as well as Ashley Curtwell and her brother . Brass reveals that the hammer found in  Benny \\'s room had  Brian \\'s blood all over it , but  Benny refuses to admit to the crime .  Benny would rather be arrested and brought to juvenile detention , which  Benny sees as a step up from living with  Benny drunk , abusive father .   Sara and  Warrick have everything taken from  Benny \\'s room laid out on a table , unable to tell what is relevant to the case .  Grissom looks over a package of orthodontic rubber bands and  Greg offers to pull DNA from them .  Greg informs them that the DNA in  Brian \\'s knuckles did n\\'t match Benny , which means that they still have n\\'t found out who  Brian hit .  Grissom wonders if the strange pattern on  Brian \\'s knuckles is from hitting someone who was wearing braces .  Warrick says that you ca n\\'t have a \" party room \" without music , and tells Grissom that  Brian belonged to a music club where  Brian got 12 CDs for the price of one . The address label as the name Aaron Gilbert on it and  Sara finds a label on one of the watermelon pieces that says \" Gilbert Organic Farms . \"   Sara ,  Warrick and Brass head back to the high school to speak to  Aaron . They tell him that they spoke to his mother and that she gave them his hammer and a $ 20 bill with a bloody fingerprint on it .  Jared \\'s brother , Jared , arrives and  Sara notices a cut on his lip .  Jared is also wearing braces . The Gilbert brothers are brought in for questioning . Brass questions  Aaron and notes that  Aaron walkman probably cost $ 125 , as did  Benny \\'s Game Boy and  Aaron brother \\'s \" secret stash . \" In the other interrogation room ,  Warrick talks to  Jared and tells  Warrick that  Warrick DNA was found in the cuts on  Brian \\'s hand . Neither brother talks .    Sara recaps the case and says that they have three hammers but four suspects .  Grissom believes that , due to the smashed watermelons , the murder was premeditated . Brass brings up that each suspect has about $ 125 in assorted items and  Grissom remembers that  Brian was being paid $ 500 every two weeks from  Grissom job . They wonder where the other $ 125 is .  Sara realizes that it went towards new clothes , earrings , and coffee - receipts that  Ashley had .   In the interrogation room ,  Sara tells  Ashley that it was  Ashley fingerprint in  Brian \\'s blood on the $ 20 bill .  Ashley changes  Ashley story and says  Ashley knew who defended  Ashley against  Brian , but did n\\'t want to get  Ashley friends in trouble . Lip gloss found in  Benny \\'s room is also a match to  Ashley . A flashback shows all four suspects in  Benny \\'s room ; the boys smashed watermelons while  Ashley cheered on .    Ashley admits that they all used to be friends with  Brian . However ,  Brian got a job and got \" too good for them . \"  Ashley lured  Brian to the construction site with the promise of sex . After  Brian lowered  Brian pants ,  Aaron ,  Benny and  Jared entered and beat  Brian to death with hammers . They took  Brian $ 500 and went their separate ways , with  Ashley celebrating by spending  Ashley money at the mall .  Sara tells  Sara that  Sara will do everything in  Sara power to get  Ashley tried as an adult ; however ,  Ashley replies that  Sara will doll  Sara up and evoke the memory of  Sara dead parents to make  Sara a sympathetic figure in the eyes of the court .   Victim : Marlene Mitchell ( deceased )   On the case : Catherine Willows , Nick Stokes , Sam Vega   Marlene Mitchell , age 32 , has been shot in the chest in the front yard of her new house .  Nick arrives on the scene and talks to Det . Vega . He says that nobody in the vicinity is carrying a weapon and that  Marlene was breaking up a fight when  Marlene got shot . Two men are talking to the police - one of the men was Marlene \\'s current husband , while the other is  Marlene ex .  Nick speaks to Stewart Mitchell , the current husband , and tests  Nick hands for gun shot residue .  Marlene says that  Nick was arguing with  Marlene \\'s ex ,  Todd , when  Marlene came out to break up the fight . When  Marlene went down ,  Nick thought  Marlene had a heart attack until  Nick saw the blood . To make matters worse ,  Todd has a restraining order against  Todd and was n\\'t allowed within 100 yards of  Marlene .   In autopsy , Doc Robbins tells  Nick that  Marlene died from a single bullet would to the heart and that  Marlene died instantly . Doc Robbins extracts the bullet and  Nick says that it \\'s a 9 mm . They test the depth of the entry wound and find that it is only four inches ; a standard handgun bullet has a penetration of twelve .  Marlene was shot at an 85-degree downward angle , which Doc Robbins notes is n\\'t much different from the standard 90-degree angle .   Bobby Dawson confirms with  Nick that no gun shot residue was found on either  Marlene or  Todd . He tells  Nick that there was no trace found on the bullet retrieved from  Marlene and that it was a standard full metal jacket . The lack of penetration suggests that something slowed the bullet down , but since the bullet was n\\'t fragmented , it did n\\'t hit anything before entering  Marlene .  Nick wonders what could have slowed the bullet down if it did n\\'t hit an intervening object .   With Catherine \\'s help ,  Nick is able to conclude that the bullet that shot  Marlene was traveling 550 feet per second . Armed with this knowledge , he can now calculate the distance .  Nick and  Bobby go to the computer and determine that a bullet would have to be fired from 1800 feet away in order to slow down to that speed .  Bobby tells  Nick that a bullet can travel further if it is fired at an angle , but  Nick responds that  Marlene was shot at an 85-degree angle .  Nick suddenly realizes that  Nick might be looking at things the wrong way -  Nick assumed that  Marlene was standing when  Marlene was shot , but that might not be the case . They look at an overhead view of the neighborhood and narrow down the area from which the bullet might have originated .    Nick and Vega canvass the neighborhood and speak to a woman who complains to them that  Marlene neighbor  Johnnie was firing  Johnnie gun a few days ago and that  Marlene yelled at  Johnnie to stop . They talk to  Johnnie who gives  Johnnie  Johnnie gun .  Nick sees that the gun has an empty ten - round magazine . There is a target nearby that  Johnnie was shooting at ; however , it has nine holes in it . A flashback shows  Johnnie shooting  his gun . When  Marlene woman yelled at  Johnnie from  Marlene window ,  his accidentally fired one shot into the air . The bullet traveled a few blocks and hit Marlene Mitchell in the chest as  Marlene was on the ground after trying to break up the fight in  Marlene yard .  Johnnie is arrested .']\n",

Doc Robbins also says he found soft tissue pockets in Zephyr \\'s mouth .  Grissom notes that  Grissom heard Houdini could regurgitate keys on cue , but has never heard of skin pockets .   In the interrogation room , Sara and Warrick go through all of  Toby \\'s props until they find a stake .

Victim : Gus Kenyon ( deceased )   On the case : Catherine Willows , Nick Stokes   Meanwhile ,  Catherine and  Nick arrive to the scene of a dead body on a tour bus .  Victim victim is Gus Kenyon , lead singer of the band Pekinpah .  Victim has a bandanna tied around  Victim right arm acting as a tourniquet and a needle filled with heroin sticking out of it . Heroin still in the syringe and a lack of vomit would make it seem like this was not an overdose .  Catherine examines  Gus \\'s right index finger to find what looks like a bruise . The silver ring he is wearing has a red color to it .  Nick notes that the tourniquet is tied off away from the body , meaning someone else likely tied it .  Catherine finds an empty bottle of whiskey next to the body . The stage manager arrives and tells them that  Gus has been clean for six years ; it \\'s a shock that he would die from an overdose .   In autopsy , Doc Robbins tells  Catherine that  Gus had no heroin in his system when he died . The cause of death was an embolism to the heart ; air was injected into the heart , which eventually led to heart failure . His blood alcohol content was .31 , which leads Doc Robbins to guess that  Gus was unconscious when his heart stopped . This would explain why the heroin did n\\'t get into his system . Doc Robbins also tells  Catherine that the black mark on the index finger was not a bruise . It was standard black printing ink .    Nick interviews the bandmates and notes that the bandanna tied around  Gus \\'s arm was used by one of the bandmates the night of their performance . They admit to leaving  Gus on the bus alone as  Gus said  Gus wanted to be alone . They also confirm that they were all clean ; they had n\\'t used drugs for the last six years . According to them ,  Gus had bouts with depression and had wanted out of the band for some time .    Greg provides  Catherine and  Nick with publications and music from the band .  Greg also tells  Greg that  Greg heard it through the grapevine that the band was splitting up .  Catherine notes that  Gus wrote all of the songs on the CD  Catherine is holding and surmises that if  Gus left the band and took the songs , the bandmates would stop making money .    Catherine goes back to the tour bus and finds a broken piece of a cell phone and the phone itself .  Catherine also finds a phone book . When  Catherine opens it up ,  Catherine finds a black smudge next to a name , Samantha Dean .

Nick shows  Catherine a CD player  Nick found that belongs to the guitarist , Keith Castle . There is a bag of heroin where the batteries should be .    Greg tells  Catherine and  Nick that  Greg found out the band was planning a \" Best Of \" album .  Greg is also able to dig up an interview that  Gus did on MTV2 saying that  Greg would never do a compilation album that one could be produced over  Greg dead body .  Greg tells  Greg that  Keith was planning the album . Under interrogation ,  Keith says that  Keith snorts the heroin , but does n\\'t shoot it .  Keith admits that  Keith and the rest of the band did n\\'t get along with  Gus .    Catherine visits the house of Samantha Dean and notices scratch marks on  Catherine red door .  Catherine tells  Catherine that  Gus looked up  Samantha \\'s name and address from the phone directory .  Samantha denies knowing  Gus and also denies answering the phone when  Gus called .  Catherine notices that  Samantha \\'s son , Brandon , is wearing some expensive green - tinted sunglasses . Outside in the car ,  Catherine listens to a CD of Pekinpah \\'s music and starts looking at the CD jacket .   Under a magnifying glass ,  Catherine and  Nick are able to see a picture of  Gus and  Samantha inside the CD jacket .  Samantha clearly lied about knowing  Gus . In the picture ,  Samantha is wearing a VIP badge and sitting with  Gus backstage .  Catherine retrieves the ring  Gus was wearing from evidence , and  Catherine and  Nick visually confirm that the red marks in the ring came from  Samantha \\'s door .    Catherine and  Nick interview  Samantha in  Catherine house . They tell  Catherine that the paint on  Gus \\'s ring matches the paint on  Catherine door .  Catherine also shows  Catherine the picture from the CD jacket and notes that the sunglasses  Gus is wearing in the picture are the same ones that  Brandon currently has in  Brandon hands .  Catherine recounts that a depressed  Gus came to the house the night before to talk to  Samantha , recognized  Brandon has  Brandon son , and give him the sunglasses . When  Catherine kicked him out , he started beating on  Catherine door .  Samantha wanted to protect  Catherine son from his father \\'s lifestyle .  Samantha is a registered nurse , meaning  Samantha had access to surgical supplies .    Samantha confesses that when  Gus left ,  Gus threatened to call a lawyer and take  Brandon away from  Samantha .  Samantha followed  Gus to the tour bus and found  Gus passed out .  Samantha injected  Gus with air , then filled the syringe with heroin to make  Gus \\'s death look like an overdose .  Catherine tells  Catherine that  Catherine would want  Catherine daughter growing up with a bad father than knowing none at all .']\n",
      "s05e17 ['Synopsis A budding serial killer strikes again , and the CSI team tries to use new technology to solve a cold case . Nick and Catherine investigate the murder of a young boy found dead in his bed . His brother confesses to the killing , but evidence suggests that he may not have committed the crime .   Plot Victim : Martha Krell ( deceased )   On the case : Gil Grissom , Greg Sanders , Sara Sidle , Jim Brass   Flight attendant Martha Krell checks into her room at the Four Aces Motel . As she goes to enter her room , someone attacks her and drags her inside . She is next seen on the bed in her underwear , stabbed to death . There is no signs of a struggle , and  Brass sees that there is also no clothes and no luggage . The trashcan is also emptied , and the smell of bleaches and deodorizers fill the room . It seems that the killer attacked the victim , then cleaned and sanitized the room .   David Phillips puts  Martha \\'s time of death at ten hours before . He and  Sara lay the body out straight to reveal that  Martha has several defensive wounds and suffered at least a dozen stab wounds . In the bathroom ,  Grissom finds a clump of hair in the bathtub drain that tests positive for blood .  Grissom has Greg label  it and sent  it to DNA . Back in the room ,  Sara tells  Grissom that hotel rooms are usually littered with prints ; however , every surface has been wiped clean .    Brass speaks to the front desk clerk that checked  Martha in .  Brass says that  Martha had been staying at the motel for a few months on a discount . When  Brass called  Martha to to relay a message to  Martha that  Martha A.M. flight had been canceled ,  Brass got no response .  Brass went to  Martha room , knocked on  Martha door and got no response . Using the master key ,  Brass entered the room to find  Martha dead . After the conversation with the clerk , the manager of the motel , Hayden Michaels , asks  Brass to everything possible to keep the crime out of the press , as it would be bad for business .   In autopsy , Doc Robbins tells  Grissom that the cause of death was exsanguination .  Martha was also raped ; a collection of sperm was sent to DNA for analysis . Meanwhile ,  Ecklie is going over a past case when  Sara enters the room . Despite having paged Grissom ,  Ecklie fills  Sara in on the case . Five years ago , a flight attendant named Sue Stein was raped and murdered in a hotel room . The scene is extremely similar to  Martha \\'s murder - Sue \\'s clothes and suitcase were missing and the room smelled like disinfectant . The only difference ,  Ecklie says , is that  Sue \\'s room was on the first floor with an unlocked sliding door leading to the pool ; however ,  Martha was murdered on the second floor with only one way in and out .  Sue was also raped and  Ecklie is having Mia Dickerson compare the samples from that case and the current one .  Sara notices that they were able to recover a fingerprint from the first scene ; it \\'s impressed in blood and the underlying pattern on the fabric made it impossible to read . However ,  Sara believes that modern technology can read the print now .   Mia Dickerson tells  Greg that the blood found on the hair in the drain is a match to  Martha . Furthermore , the semen recovered is consistent with the semen recovered from the first attack ; the same rapist has committed both murders . Under the microscope , they discover that the man \\'s immune system does n\\'t recognize his own sperm and that the antibodies are attacking it . Both  Greg and Mia recall an article they read that explains this phenomena - the killer had a vasectomy , then had it reversed .   Lab tech Neil Jansen is able to digitally separate the bloody fingerprint from the fabric . The print is run through AFIS and it comes back to a Jesse Acheson , who has a long criminal record .  Sara confirms that  Jesse was out of prison during both murders , and  Sara , Brass and some uniformed officers visit  Jesse \\'s last known address .  Jesse \\'s wife Michelle answers the door and tells  Sara and Brass that  Sara does n\\'t know where  Sara husband is and that  Sara has n\\'t seen him in days . After the conversation is over ,  Sara tells Brass and the officers to drive around the block and pick  Sara up in five minutes .  Sara peers through the window and watches  Michelle call  Jesse on the phone . In a one - sided conversation ,  Michelle tells  Jesse that the cops were just at the house and  Sara wants to know where he is .  Jesse apparently hangs up on  Sara , and  Sara backs away from the window .   In the lab ,  Sara tells  Grissom that  Sara got a court order for  Michelle \\'s phone records and has been able to narrow down  Jesse \\'s approximate location .  Sara had officers check registrations at the hotels in the targeted area and has found that  Jesse is booked at the Tangiers .  Greg enters and says that the rapist \\'s semen came back positive for cocaine . Grissom ,  Greg and  Sara try figuring out  Jesse \\'s timeline , but find it odd that  Greg would be dealing drugs out of one hotel , go to another hotel to rape and kill the victim , then head back to the first hotel to continue dealing .   A judge denies  Grissom \\'s request for a search warrant for  Jesse \\'s hotel room , saying that a five - year old fingerprint \" manipulated \" on a computer is not enough .  Sara adds that if the print were later to be thrown out in court , then everything found as a result of it would be excluded and the rapist would go free .  Grissom is told that  Grissom can get  Grissom warrant if  Grissom provides more evidence , but  Grissom tells the judge that  Grissom needs the warrant in order to get more evidence . Meanwhile ,  Greg and Officer Akers keep surveillance on  Jesse at a cafe . When  Jesse gets up and leaves  Jesse coffee cup behind ,  Greg collects it as evidence .   Mia tells  Sara that the DNA contribution on the cup is not consistent with  Jesse \\'s DNA .  Jesse is brought in for questioning and tells  Sara that  Jesse does n\\'t know how  Jesse fingerprint ended up on the bedspread .  Jesse admits , though , that  Jesse went to see  Sue the night  Sue was murdered . When  Jesse entered  Sue hotel room and flipped  Sue body over ,  Jesse saw that  Sue was covered in blood . A flashback shows  Jesse wiping  Jesse bloody hand on the bedspread and leaving . Since  Jesse was on probation ,  Jesse did n\\'t report the murder to the cops .  Jesse tells  Sara and Brass that  Jesse and  Sue had an arrangement - whenever  Sue was in town ,  Jesse would sell  Sue drugs . This explains why  Sue door was unlocked .    Hodges pages  Grissom to the trace lab and tells  Grissom that the hair pulled from the bathtub drain was coated in bleach . However ,  Grissom adds that the bleach had a woodsy smell to it . Results of an analysis of the bleach indicate that it had contained a cedar additive .  Grissom admits that this is the first time that  Hodges has impressed  Grissom .    Grissom and Brass speak to Hayden Michaels , who has offered to help out any way  Grissom can . With  Grissom is Lucy , one of the maids at the motel .  She tells them that  She started adding cedar chips to the bleach because guests were complaining of the bleach smell . The maids are the only ones with access to the bleach and they are all female . Brass wonders if anyone walking by could have swiped the bleach , but Lucy says that all maids bring their carts into the rooms to prevent theft . While this is going on ,  Grissom looks at the photos on  Hayden \\'s desk . When questioned ,  Hayden confirms that  Hayden has been married more than once and  Grissom notes that this means  Hayden had  Hayden vasectomy reversed .  Hayden would also have had access to the bleach .  Hayden is somewhat startled at the subject matter of these questions and refuses to give a DNA sample , as being labeled a murder suspect would put an end to  Hayden days working in hospitality .    Hayden is brought to the station for questioning and  Grissom tells  Hayden that during  Hayden twenty - five years of working ,  Hayden \\'s come to understand the kind of person who is a rapist - killer .  Grissom tells  Hayden  Grissom theory about how the killer likely fantasized about the attack for years and after finally going through with it ,  Hayden felt a level of excitement greater than what was anticipated .  Hayden adds that what differentiates a psychopath from a \" heat - of - the - moment \" killer is forethought . A flashback shows  Hayden wiping down the hotel room with bleach .  Grissom says that  Hayden was thinking about  Grissom crime for a long time .  Hayden \\'s lawyer says the evidence is circumstantial and they get up to leave .    Sara then enters with a wheeled luggage bag and claims that  Sara has some evidence . An irate  Hayden blurts out that  Sara had no right to go into his car and his lawyer says that no warrant was ever issued .  Sara says that  Sara was following a hunch and found out that the airline supplied this type of luggage bag to all of its flight attendants . Since  Martha \\'s bag was n\\'t in  Sara room ,  Sara figured that the killer took it as a souvenir .  Sara unzips the luggage bag to reveal a tape recorder . Now , the police know where to search to find  Martha \\'s luggage bag and  Hayden has just admitted to  Hayden guilt .   Victim : Ty Hawkins ( deceased )   On the case : Catherine Willows , Nick Stokes , Warrick Brown , Chris Cavaliere    Catherine and  Nick are called to a scene to investigate the murder of 12-year old Ty Hawkins , who has been beaten to  death while sleeping in  death bed . David Phillips puts the time of death around midnight . There is no sign of forced entry and nothing appears to be missing . All of the windows and doors in the house were locked except for the screen door ; Ty \\'s parents claim that they locked that , as well .    Catherine processes the inside of the house , while  Nick takes the outside . In the laundry room ,  Catherine finds boxers , a fitted sheet and a t - shirt that all tested positive for urine . Outside ,  Nick finds a shoe impression in the dirt outside of the bedroom window . The word \" BRAT \" is also etched into the window . As  Nick walks around the property ,  Nick finds a pile of pipes and later notes to  Catherine that one seems to be missing .  Nick comments that whoever killed  Ty knew how to get in and out of the house without disturbing anyone .    Nick and Det . Cavaliere question Ty \\'s father ,  Martin .  Nick says that  Nick and  Nick wife , Yvonne , went to bed after the news .  Nick questions out loud why someone would do this to  Ty and becomes angered when  Nick starts to process  Nick .  Martin is fingerprinted and a DNA sample is taken before  Martin and  Martin wife are allowed to go home . However , their other son , Matt , is kept in police custody until the case is resolved .  Nick asks Det .  Cavaliere how  Nick could just let the parents go home ;  Nick \\'s told neither of them have a record or motive and that no blood was found on them . After  Nick suggests that the parents could have showered and dumped their clothes , Det .  Cavaliere says that , based on years of talking to grieving  parents ,  Cavaliere can tell  parents grief is not an act .   In autopsy , Doc Robbins tells  Catherine that the cause of death was blunt force trauma .  Ty suffered fourteen separate blows from a cylindrical weapon about one inch in diameter .  Catherine asks if the weapon could be a pipe and the doc confirms this , showing  Catherine that one of the wounds contains a thread pattern that is consistent with the end of a pipe .  Ty also has no defense wounds and Doc Robbins guesses that he never woke up during the attack .   Matt Hawkins sits in interrogation and hands over his shoes .  Det .  Cavaliere goes full court press on Matt , accusing him of murder . He gets in Matt \\'s face and yells at him , telling him he \\'s going to prison .  Det .  Cavaliere gets angrier as Matt remains silent and looks at  Nick .  Nick interrupts and asks to speak to  Det .  Cavaliere outside . He tells him that  they do n\\'t have enough evidence to suggest that Matt is the killer and suggests  they ask different questions or take a different approach .  Det .  Cavaliere takes offense and says to  Nick that  Nick does n\\'t tell  Nick how to do  Nick job .  Nick insists that they are all on the same team , but the detective wants  Nick to find evidence to use against Matt .    Catherine processes  Ty \\'s t - shirt and finds a hair and some blue fibers on it .  Catherine later finds that the hair is consistent with Matt . Meanwhile ,  Nick compares everyone \\'s shoes with the print found outside of the bedroom window ; the print is also a match to Matt .  Nick tells  Catherine that  these could be findings important to the case , or  these can just be the result of two brothers living together . The blue fibers are currently unexplained , as nobody in the family was wearing blue at the time they were brought in for questioning .  Nick shares  Nick concern with  Catherine about  Det .  Cavaliere getting ahead of the forensics , but  Cavaliere says that the district attorney wo n\\'t file without any evidence .    Nick visits  Det .  Cavaliere and tells  Nick that , with no evidence , Matt ca n\\'t be held in custody for more than twenty - four hours .  Det .  Cavaliere shows him a signed confession from Matt and says that he caught him lying on a voice stress analyzer . Once the lie was caught , Matt confessed to murdering his brother .  Nick tells him that the device has been discredited for years and is not used in Vegas or in the state of Nevada .  Det .  Cavaliere admits that Matt \\'s parents or an advocate were not present at the time of the confession , but as long as Matt understands his rights , nobody needs to be there with him . Matt has not said why he killed his brother , but  Det .  Cavaliere is sure  Cavaliere will eventually .  Cavaliere thanks  Nick for helping out and insists that the police can handle it from there .    Warrick , fresh off of testifying in court , was filled on the case  Nick is working on .  Warrick was told by the district attorney that Matt \\'s confession would hold up in court .  Nick is still not certain in Matt \\'s guilt , believing that  Det .  Cavaliere intimidated  Nick into confessing . Furthermore , there have been some disturbance calls in the Hawkins neighborhood about a homeless guy running around peeping in windows and urinating in public .  Nick says  Nick \\'s going back to talk to the family and  Warrick offers to tag along .    Martin and Yvonne Hawkins tell  Nick and Warrick that the homeless man scared their boys once or twice and that  Ty caught him writing something on the window .  Nick confirms that the word \" brat \" is what was written . Matt then cleaned it afterwards , which would explain why his shoe impression was found outside of the bedroom window .  Martin tells them that  Martin jogs in the park every evening and that the homeless guy has a makeshift tent set up there . Nick , Warrick and some uniformed officers head to the park and find the homeless guy asleep in the tent . The man is dragged out and reveals his name to be  Walter . He is wearing a blue sweater with blood stains on  it ; when asked , he does n\\'t say where he got  it .  Walter is arrested for suspicion of murder and brought in for questioning .    Det .  Cavaliere stops  Nick in the hallway and asks  Walter why  Walter continues to meddle in the case .  Nick insists that  Walter \\'s just following leads and convinces  Walter to interrogate  Walter .  Walter admits to having found the bloody sweater on a bench in the park , but can not recall exactly when  Walter found it . As  Walter is taken away to be put in lockup , Det .  Cavaliere tells  Nick that  Cavaliere has a signed confession , while  Nick has a homeless guy in a sweater . Clearly ,  Nick needs more evidence .    Nick processes the sweater and , using the UV light , finds an invisible dry cleaner ID stamp .  Nick called the dry cleaners and found out that the sweater belongs to Martin Hawkins .  Martin confirms to  Nick that it is  Nick sweater ; however ,  Nick says  Nick has n\\'t seen it in a while .  Nick tells  Nick that  Nick son \\'s blood is on the sweater and  Martin asks if he \\'s going to need a lawyer .   Catherine ,  Nick and Warrick go over the three suspects and scenarios they have - 1 ) Matt wore his father \\'s sweater , killed  Ty and dumped the sweater in the park at night , 2 )  Martin killed  Martin son while wearing the sweater and later dumped it in the park , or 3 ) the sweater could have been accidentally left in the park where  Walter found it , broke into the house through the screen door , and killed Matt .  Catherine asks what each suspect \\'s height is and tells  Nick and Warrick to meet  Catherine in the garage later for an experiment .    Catherine notes that  Warrick is about  Martin \\'s height and  Nick is about  Walter \\'s height . Judy , a coworker , is brought in because  Catherine \\'s about the same height as Matt . A dummy covered in red dye is elevated off the ground at the same height Matt \\'s bed was . Wearing white sweaters , all three take whacks at the dummy with a pipe to recreate the blood spatter pattern . When the carnage is over , the blood spatter on Judy \\'s sweater is similar to the one on the blue sweater .   Back in interrogation , Matt tells Nick and Det . Cavaliere that he already confessed and refuses to say why he killed his brother .  Warrick , watching from behind the two - way glass , lets  Martin enter the room to talk to  Warrick son . There , Matt admits that he got mad at  Ty for telling everyone that he wet the bed . Matt is arrested and taken away in handcuffs .  Det .  Cavaliere tells  Nick that he wants an apology ;  Nick tells him that he \\'s sorry the detective feels that way .']\n",
      "s05e03 ['Synopsis An Amber Alert is sent out when a young girl , Alicia Perez , is kidnapped . Meanwhile , Catherine has to deal with Lindsey , who was caught hitchhiking .   Plot Victim : Alicia Perez ( missing )   On the case : Entire team   Outside of St. Andrew \\'s School ,  Alicia Perez \\'s mother waits for  Alicia after the school day ends . Sybil Perez asks a nun where  Alicia daughter is , but the nun replies that  Alicia was n\\'t in school all day . Sybil then gets a call from her other daughter , April - 13-year old Alicia has been kidnapped . She drives to the convenience store where the kidnapping took place and slaps  April for letting this happen .   The CSIs arrive on the scene .  April tells Brass that  Alicia \\'s life was n\\'t great and that the two of them did n\\'t see each other often , so she would sometimes play hooky and spend the day together . While  April was in the store ,  Alicia changed into  Alicia school uniform to make it look  Alicia was in school all day .  April says that  Alicia was kidnapped by a black man with a beard driving a black ( or dark blue ) Buick . Meanwhile ,  Grissom is taking photos of  April \\'s car when  Grissom is approached by Sybil and Alicia \\'s father , Carlos .  Grissom tells them that they \\'re doing everything they can to find  Alicia .  Grissom then notices some blood on Sybil \\'s shirt , which Sybil claims is from a nosebleed .  Grissom tells Sybil that the shirt will have to be collected as evidence , and an angry and distraught Sybil takes the shirt off and throws it at  Grissom .   An AMBER Alert is issued for  Alicia .  Nick and  Warrick work the convenience store parking lot , where  Nick reveals that  Nick failed  Nick firearms qualification .  Nick wonders how someone as old as  Alicia was lured by a kidnapper ;  Warrick figures that the kidnapper pretended he was lost and snatched  Alicia when  Alicia got too close to the car .  Catherine adds that  Alicia was probably hit , as well .  Grissom walks up and informs  Nick that  Grissom ca n\\'t be out in the field since  Grissom failed the firearms qualification ; in fact , just carrying a weapon is a violation .  Nick adheres the rules and says that  Nick \\'ll help from the lab . Meanwhile ,  Catherine gets a call and leaves the scene with  Nick , as the call is about  Lindsey . Elsewhere , in the convenience store , Brass talks to the store clerk . The clerk says that he was checking  April out ; then  April started screaming and ran . He claims that he never saw  Alicia or the car that  Alicia was kidnapped in . The clerk adds that there are five security cameras inside of the store ; however , the cameras outside of the store are all fakes .   In the police station , an officer tells  Catherine that  Lindsey was caught hitchhiking . Hitchhiking is the third strike in  Catherine \\'s eyes , as  Lindsey has also been talking back to teachers and has had dropping grades .  Lindsey suggests that  Lindsey should strip like  Lindsey mother used to . This results in an argument with  Lindsey storming out . Elsewhere in the lab ,  Warrick is going over the contents of  Alicia \\'s backpack .  Greg and new DNA lab hire Mia Dickerson enter .  Warrick asks  Greg what \\'s missing ; when  Greg does n\\'t know ,  Greg says that  Alicia supposedly changed out of  Alicia clothes and into  Alicia school clothes . However , there are no street clothes to be found .  Warrick gives  Sybil \\'s bloody shirt to  Mia for DNA extraction .   In the Perez house , Brass interviews Carlos and  Sybil . They were unaware that  Alicia had been skipping school to spend time with  April and tell Brass that  April had been kicked out of the house .  Alicia had had problems with drugs and the police and had also spent time in juvenile lockup for heroin possession with an intent to distribute . Meanwhile ,  Grissom and  Sara are looking through  Alicia \\'s room . On  Alicia \\'s computer ,  Sara finds that  Alicia visited an organ transplant website .  Sara then finds a notebook where  Alicia has written down the name \" Jimmy Jones \" several times accompanied by hearts . On the underside of the bed linens ,  Grissom finds the words \" I hate mom & dad . \"  Grissom is interrupted by Alicia \\'s brother ,  Daniel .  Daniel recognizes the name Jimmy Jones and says that  Daniel was a boy from Alicia \\'s school .  Daniel tells  Grissom and Sara that  Alicia was a giver ever since birth .  Grissom then notices that  Daniel has a nosebleed .  Daniel excuses  Daniel and tells them to read  Alicia \\'s diary that  Alicia kept under  Alicia bed .  Sara opens it up and reads and entry  Alicia wrote about having surgery ; this seems to connect with the organ transplant web search . Back in the living room , Carlos and  Sybil tell  Brass that  Daniel has failing kidneys and that  Alicia is  Daniel matching donor . Without  Alicia ,  Daniel will die .   Catherine and  Brass question Jimmy Jones .  Jimmy tells them that  Alicia was a pretty good soccer player , but quit the team before  Alicia got cut .  Alicia would miss practice a lot because  Alicia was always going to the doctor .  Alicia had told  Jimmy about  Alicia kidney and the fact that  Alicia was saving  Daniel \\'s life ; however ,  Jimmy says that  Alicia seemed quite upset about doing so .  Alicia had told  Jimmy that  Alicia had no life and never would .  Jimmy tells  Brass that , on  their way to school ,  their would pass by a black man with a beard and mustache who was about 30 years old . The man , who seems to match the description of the kidnapper , would be out for a jog or a run ; however , he was dressed in velour and always on the phone .  Jimmy says that the guy gave him the creeps .   In the lab ,  Nick has Alicia \\'s neighborhood and walking route to school up on the computer , as well as the location of the convenience store .  Nick shows  Grissom and Warrick the map of all registered sex offenders in the vicinity and there are surprisingly a lot of them .  Nick narrows the search down to Tier 2 and Tier 3 sex offenders , as  Grissom notes that  they would be more likely to plan an abduction and find the privacy for sexual assault and murder .  they find a Tier 2 offender named Marlon Wayward who lives in Alicia \\'s neighborhood and fits the description that  Jimmy gave to Brass .    Marlon answers the door at  Marlon house and  Grissom notices a cut on  Marlon \\'s chin from shaving .  Brass speaks to  Marlon outside while  Grissom and  Sara search the inside of the house . Inside ,  Grissom finds a jacket on a hanger with a hair sticking out from it .  Sara finds the presence of semen on bedsheets , as well as a pair of boy \\'s underwear .  Grissom finds  Marlon \\'s phone ; the phone contains pictures of  Alicia and  Jimmy as they were walking to school . Outside ,  Marlon tells  Brass that  Marlon black Buick is in the Tangiers parking lot because it would n\\'t start .  Marlon is arrested and brought in for questioning . In the interrogation room ,  Marlon recognizes  Alicia from  Marlon photo ; however ,  Marlon tells  Grissom and Brass that  Marlon was looking at  Jimmy .  Marlon adds that  Marlon bought the pair of underwear  Marlon and would use  Jimmy \\'s photo as a \" release . \"  Marlon tells  Grissom that  Marlon has a disease , but  Grissom corrects  Marlon by saying it \\'s a compulsion .    Warrick visits  Greg and  Mia in the DNA lab and finds out that the semen on the underwear belonged to  Marlon and that the only DNA on the underwear was  Marlon \\'s , as well .  Marlon is therefore ruled out as a suspect .  Warrick then receives a call :  Alicia \\'s body has been found . Catherine ,  Grissom and  Warrick meet  Brass in a field where  Alicia \\'s body has been wrapped up tightly in a bloody blanket .  Catherine notes that  Alicia \\'s face is covered , meaning that the killer probably expressed remorse or guilt .  Catherine also notices that  Alicia has been redressed and that  Catherine panties are missing .  Grissom has Catherine and  Warrick search the surrounding area ;  Warrick finds a shoeprint and photographs it .  Alicia \\'s liver temperature is 90 degrees and David Phillips tells  Grissom that it should be higher ;  Grissom figures the weather has something to do with the odd reading .   In autopsy ,  Grissom takes photos of  Alicia \\'s body while David Phillips discusses his findings . There are no signs of sexual assault and  Alicia has no defensive wounds on  Alicia body .  Grissom notes that there was blood on the blanket ; since  Alicia has no wounds , the blood could belong to the killer . David flips  Alicia \\'s body over to reveal two long parallel bruises on  Alicia back .  Grissom mentions that  Alicia \\'s body was n\\'t laying on top of anything at the scene . As  Grissom goes to take another photo of the body ,  Grissom stops , looks at the body , and shakes  Grissom head .    Catherine sits down next to an exhausted  Grissom and tells  Grissom about  Lindsey \\'s hitchhiking attempt .  Grissom replies that if  people knew what was out there hunting  people ,  people would never leave the house .  Grissom suggests to  Catherine that  Catherine prepare  Lindsey for the outside world without scaring  Catherine .  Grissom then visits Doc Robbins , who shows Grissom Alicia \\'s x - ray .  Alicia has pinpoint holes in both shoulders from donating bone marrow to  Alicia brother .  Grissom mentions Daniel \\'s symptoms to Doc Robbins ; the doc believes the symptoms point to acute leukemia . The doc says that  Alicia \\'s cause of death was cardiopulmonary arrest and that the only thing in  Alicia stomach was a milky liquid .  Alicia \\'s time of  death is put at between midnight and 8:00 AM the day of  Alicia kidnapping , meaning that  Alicia sister was lying about the abduction .    Brass interrogates  April and tells  Alicia that  Alicia story has a lot of holes -  Alicia was already dead when the AMBER alert was issued and there were no signs of sexual assault . He tells  Alicia that filing a false AMBER alert is 1 - 4 years in prison and murder will get  Alicia either life in prison or the death penalty , depending on whether  death death was accidental or not .  April vehemently denies killing  Alicia sister , but  Brass knows  Alicia was in on it since  Alicia lied about the abduction . Brass points out that  Daniel was the center of attention since  Daniel \\'s sick and that  Alicia was  Daniel savior , meaning  April did n\\'t fit in with the family . Maybe  Alicia killed Alicia , which in turn would lead to  Daniel dying and making  April the family \\'s focus again ?  April denies this , as well .  Brass wonders if  April is on  drugs again and whether  drugs should test  Alicia blood .    Catherine and  Grissom go over the Perez family medical records and have them outlined on a chart .  Daniel was diagnosed with relapsing acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) when  Daniel was ten years old , and  Alicia was conceived in vitro to be  Daniel genetic match .  Alicia had a blood transfusion when  Alicia was four and donated bone marrow when  Alicia was seven .  Daniel relapsed , which is why  Alicia donated bone marrow a second time .  Grissom states that  Alicia was a DNA factory .  Catherine is stopped by Sybil Perez in the station hallway , and  Catherine tells  Catherine that  April will be released on bail and that  Catherine is refusing to talk about what happened to  Alicia .  Sybil laments not giving enough attention to  April , but  Catherine admonishes  Sybil for using  Alicia only as a means to help  Daniel .  Catherine tells  Catherine that  Catherine put one child over another , but  Sybil replies that  Sybil did what  Sybil had to do .  Sybil guesses that  Catherine does n\\'t have children ;  Catherine says  Catherine has a daughter , and  Sybil calls  Catherine out for working nights and not spending time with  Catherine .  Alicia \\'s life might not have been easy ,  Sybil says , but at least  Sybil knew  Sybil daughter .   In the lab ,  Sybil tells  Grissom that the blood on  Sybil \\'s shirt matches the blood that was found on the blanket and that the blood was Alicia \\'s . He is surprised that the blood is n\\'t menstrual and that the amount of blood present would suggest injury or trauma . Despite  Sybil \\'s insistence that  Sybil was thorough when  Sybil ran the tests ,  Grissom asks  Sybil to run them again . Elsewhere in the lab ,  Greg and  Sara go through  April \\'s laundry and garbage .  Greg finds a crumpled up piece of paper with Mapquest directions from Marlon Waylord \\'s house to the convenience store . Down in the morgue ,  Catherine shows  Lindsey the body of a dead 23-year old female as a way to scare  Lindsey straight . Doc Robbins enters and berates  Catherine for this decision , but  Catherine tells him that this does n\\'t concern him .   In the A / V lab , Archie does a reverse lookup on the Mapquest search and finds that the account used for the search belongs to  Sybil .  Sara ,  Warrick and Brass visit the  Perez residence again .  Brass presents a warrant and asks where  Daniel is ;  Sybil replies that  Daniel is at church . Inside the house ,  Sara photographs a laptop , then finds a cabinet where various medications are stored . There is Oxycodone in  Daniel \\'s name , while  Alicia \\'s name is on bottles of Diazepam .  Sara photographs the bottles , as well as a whiteboard medication calendar . Elsewhere ,  Warrick finds a pair of work boots that belong to  Carlos ; they have the same tread pattern that  Warrick photographed earlier at the crime scene . In the bedroom ,  Warrick bags a bloody handkerchief and finds blue fibers on the bed seemingly consistent with the blanket  Alicia \\'s body was wrapped in .  Sara enters and tells  Warrick about the medications  Sara found - Daniel \\'s Oxycodone was for pain , but  Alicia \\'s Diazepam was an anti - depressant .  Sara guesses that  Alicia \\'s parents did n\\'t want  Sara complaining while  Sara body was used for  Daniel \\'s health . Outside , Nick ( who has passed his firearms qualification test ) finds a tripod in the trunk of  Carlos \\'s car . He notes to  Sara and  Warrick that when folded up , the tripod \\'s legs match the lividity marks found on  Alicia \\'s back .    Brass interrogates  Carlos and  Sybil separately .  Carlos admits to being guilty and wanting to protect  Carlos family .  Brass has a longer conversation with  Sybil and presents  Brass hypothesis :  Sybil helped move  Alicia \\'s body and came up with the idea to remove the underwear .  Sybil then contacted  April and they used the sex offenders registry to frame  Marlon .  Marlon guesses that after being constantly used as a means to get  Daniel better ,  Alicia finally stood up to  Alicia mother and said no .  Alicia wanted to keep  Alicia kidney and  Alicia wanted to live a normal life .  Marlon guesses that  Alicia wanted out , but  Sybil would n\\'t let  Sybil .  Sybil slipped  Alicia too much Oxycodone , then panicked and came up with the kidnapping story .  Sybil says that  Alicia loved  Daniel and that  Alicia would never forgive  Sybil if  Daniel died and  Sybil did nothing about it .  Brass adds that the slap at the convenience store was a nice touch .    Warrick tells  Grissom that the blue fibers  Warrick found were consistent with the blanket  Alicia was wrapped in and that the work boots were consistent with the shoe prints found at the crime scene .  Greg interjects and says that  Warrick retested the bloody shirt and blanket , and that the blood still matches  Alicia .  Warrick tells  Grissom to accept change and stop second - guessing  Sybil \\'s procedures , as  Sybil is doing a great job .  Grissom agrees and apologizes .  Greg adds that the blood on the handkerchief found in the  Perez bedroom also matches  Alicia .  Grissom then comes to a realization .    Grissom visits the church where  Daniel is .  Daniel tells  Grissom that  Grissom realizes how lucky  Grissom is -  Grissom knows how and when  Grissom \\'s going to die , while most people do n\\'t .  Grissom says that  Alicia was never scared and that  Alicia never gave up on  Alicia or  Grissom .  Daniel recounts making  Daniel parents swear that after  Daniel last relapse , they would n\\'t put  Alicia through the medical procedures again . However , after  Daniel \\'s kidneys started failing ,  Daniel parents said that their promise only related to the cancer , not the kidneys .  Daniel admits to putting an end to  Alicia \\'s pain by drugging  Alicia milk .  Alicia blood was in  Daniel \\'s veins , which is why the blood results kept coming back to  Alicia . When  Daniel wrapped  Alicia \\'s body in the blanket ,  Daniel nose bled onto it .    Grissom asks  Daniel why  Grissom did n\\'t just take  Grissom own life instead of  Alicia \\'s and  Grissom replies that suicide is an unforgiveable sin in the eyes of  God .  God forgiving murder wo n\\'t keep  Daniel out of jail ,  Grissom says . However ,  Daniel says that  Daniel will be dead in six months before there \\'s even a trial .  Daniel thanks  Grissom for being the only person in  Alicia \\'s life that only thought of  Alicia .  Daniel tells  Grissom that while  Grissom may not believe in God ,  Grissom \\'s doing God \\'s work .']\n",
      "s05e21 ['Synopsis Sara accompanies  Grissom to a mental hospital where one of its inmates has been murdered inside  Grissom room . Interviewing patients proves to be harder than usual , as most of them are mentally unstable . While the two CSIs are there , they uncover more than just the crime . One of the most shocking discoveries involves a patient with a dark childhood , which is still haunting  Grissom , and a nurse with a secret .   Plot Victim : Robbie Garson ( deceased )   On the case : Gil Grissom , Greg Sanders , Sara Sidle , Sofia Curtis , Jim Brass   During a stormy night at Desert State Mental Hospital , nurse Nanette Faber finds patient Robbie Garson dead on the floor in his room . Nearby , another patient , Kenny Valdez , is crouched in the corner covered in blood . Grissom ,  Sara and Brass are called to the scene and are told that the hospital houses two types of patients : the criminally insane and sexually violent predators . They are also informed that the patients \\' doors are not locked at night , as doing so would lead to the patients trying to harm themselves .  Grissom and  Sara look inside  Robbie \\'s room and  Grissom sees blood spatter on the wall .   They are then escorted to the seclusion room , where a frantic  Kenny is being strapped to a bed .  Kenny has wounds on  Kenny arms , which Nurse Faber says are from self mutilation .  Kenny suffers from Renfield \\'s Syndrome , meaning that  Kenny gets off on blood . Nurse Faber confirms that the clothes  Kenny is currently wearing are the clothes  Kenny was found in .  Grissom and  Sara talk in the hallway , and  Grissom notes that there was blood spatter on the wall of  Robbie \\'s room , but there is no spatter on  Kenny \\'s clothes . It does n\\'t seem that  Kenny is the guy they \\'re looking for .    Sara photographs  Robbie \\'s room and finds a picture on the wall held up by blue tape of two guys sitting in chairs . Next to the picture is an empty space with more blue tape , indicating that another picture used to hang there .  Sara collects the tape as evidence . As  Sara examines the rooms further ,  Sara finds evidence of semen on  Robbie \\'s bed . Under the mattress ,  Sara finds magazine ads featuring young boys . Meanwhile ,  Grissom and Brass talk to the various patients of the hospital ; their rap sheets include rape , murder , delusions and suicide attempts . They get no answers about the murder but find out that one patient believes he has a cricket in his head , while another speaks to  Grissom in nonsensical sentences .    Sara talks to the facility \\'s on - call doctor , Valerie Dino .  Sara tells  Sara that  Robbie had been chemically castrated and was unable to ejaculate . This means that the semen on his bed belongs to someone else .  Sara relays this information to  Grissom and Brass . Thinking that the semen could belong to the killer ,  Grissom and  Sara take a DNA sample from each patient as well as the staff . While doing so ,  Sara has one patient lunge at  Sara and start mumbling to himself .   In autopsy , Doc Robbins shows  Grissom the various things  Robbie had in  Grissom stomach at the time of  Grissom death , including band - aids , hair and half of a snapshot .  Grissom guesses that  Robbie has pica , a compulsion to eat non - nutritive food items . The pulling out and eating of hair is another OCD disorder called trichotillomania . There are lacerations on  Robbie \\'s face , as well as a skull fracture . However , Doc Robbins says that the cause of death is actually asphyxiation and that the head trauma occurred two hours after the suffocation . Ligature marks are also found on the victim \\'s wrists and ankles , leading  Grissom to believe that  Robbie was restrained .  Robbie notes that nobody at the hospital mentioned restraints to  Robbie .    Robbie tells  Sara that some of the hair in  Robbie \\'s system has bleached tips . Furthermore , the tox report shows that  Robbie had olanzapine and ibuprofen in  Robbie system .  Sara notes that  Robbie \\'s chart showed that  Robbie was on at least four other anti - psychotics .   Brass informs  Grissom that the hospital had two other reported deaths in the last three years from \" complications due to restraint procedures . \" One more death would bring the feds in and the hospital would likely get shut down . They note that this is good incentive for the hospital to keep it quiet or pin the murder on a patient .   Grissom ,  Sara and Brass visit the hospital again and talk to the administrator . They are shown the surveillance video of  Robbie being restrained in the seclusion room the day  Robbie died . The video later shows  Robbie being escorted out of the room alive .  Sara asks why  Robbie would be short four anti - psychotic meds and the administrator explains that the patients may \" cheek \" them , deciding to sell them , trade them , or collect them and take them all at once to get high . They are directed to the pharmacist , Leon Cadera .    Sara and Brass pay a visit to  Leon and find that  Leon \\'s giving the patients a range of medication including aspirin , ibuprofen and laxatives .  Sara also notices that  Leon has bleached hair .  Leon is brought to the station for interrogation , where  Leon admits that  Leon does n\\'t get paid much for all of the abuse  Leon suffers and that  Leon sells the drugs on the side to make extra money . Brass theorizes that  Robbie caught  Leon changing the meds and threatened to report  Robbie , and  Leon killed  Robbie in order to silence  Robbie .  Robbie denies this and says that the reason  Robbie was in seclusion was because  Robbie freaked out in group .   Grissom and  Sara go over the video logs and confirm that  Robbie was in seclusion for two hours . Nurse McKay noted that  Robbie was awake and in bed by the 9:30 PM checks . Since the body was found shortly after midnight ,  Sara figures that  Robbie was killed closer to 9:30 since the blood needed time to coagulate .  Greg enters and tells  them that  Robbie \\'s pillow had a lot of saliva on it .  Greg also shows  them that are slits on either end of the pillow , indicating that someone grabbed it and smothered  Robbie .    Sara goes to the hospital and talks to Nurse McKay , who is on a cigarette break .  Sara tells  Sara that  Robbie brought a personal item to group , which is not allowed , and that the item was a photograph of a little boy . A flashback shows  Robbie caressing the photo ; when Nurse McKay got up to take it away ,  Robbie started yelling and shoved it into  Robbie mouth .  Robbie was then medicated , secluded and restrained . Nurse McKay admits that the never mentioned this because things like this happen every day . After the conversation is over ,  Sara gets a call from Grissom , who tells  Sara that the semen recovered from  Robbie \\'s bed belonged to another patient , Adam Trent .   Grissom and  Sara search  Adam \\'s room ; one of the walls is adorned with dark , detailed drawings .  Sara removes one to look at  it but drops  it behind the dresser . As  Sara goes to pick  it up ,  Sara finds an air vent and spots something inside of  it . After removing the vent , they discover a stack of letters addressed to  Adam that are postdated over a year ago along with a hairbrush .   Dr. Dino reveals to  Grissom and  Sara that the letters addressed to  Adam are from  Adam mother and that their relationship is incestual . When Adam \\'s father died when he was little , his mother replaced him with her son . This caused  Adam to become schizophrenic , suicidal and a pathological narcissist . Since  Adam was unable to retaliate against  Adam mother ,  Adam became incapable of actual intimacy and started raping women . Dr. Dino confirms that  Adam has only raped women , which does n\\'t explain why is semen was found in  Robbie \\'s bed . Dr. Dino says that  Adam \\'s mother lives near Reno and that every time she sent her son a letter , it resulted in a manic episode and severe depression , as well as a suicide attempt .  Adam \\'s mother stopped sending letters once Dr. Dino returned  them to her without giving  them to  Adam .    Grissom and  Sara interrogate  Adam , and  Adam admits to the murder because  Robbie was gay .  Adam does n\\'t know why  Adam went through with the sexual act but says that  Adam smashed  Robbie \\'s head into the floor . As the interrogation goes on ,  Adam becomes fixated on  Sara , staring at  Sara face , fingernails and other parts of  Sara body .  Adam tells them to check the bucket in the bathroom for proof that  Adam \\'s guilty .  Adam then admits to  Adam guilt , saying that  Adam killed  Robbie because  Adam \\'s crazy .    Grissom and  Sara check the bathroom and discuss  Adam \\'s admission . There was no mention of suffocation and since  Adam bites  Adam nails , there is no way  Adam would have been able to dig them into the pillow . In the bucket ,  Sara finds clothes that have blood spatter on them . There \\'s also a pair of boxer shorts that have a red mark around the crotch ; they immediately know that it \\'s lipstick .  Sara goes back outside to where Nurse McKay was taking  Sara cigarette break and bags one of the cigarettes as evidence .  Sara asks the officer on duty for access to the nurse \\'s station .   At the nurse \\'s station ,  Sara finds the photo that Nurse McKay confiscated from  Robbie in group .  Sara notices blue tape on the top of the photo and thinks it could be the other half of the photo on the wall in  Robbie \\'s room . The photo is of a young boy that looks suspiciously like  Adam . After  Grissom has trouble opening some of the drawers ,  Grissom goes to look for someone who can assist . While  Grissom is away ,  Adam sneaks into the room and corners  Sara .  Sara grabs a syringe , but  Adam overpowers  Sara and holds a hardened piece of clay against  Sara neck . When  Grissom returns with an orderly , they find that the door is locked .  Grissom looks into the room and is horrified at what  Grissom sees . Nurse McKay appears and distracts  Adam long enough for  Sara to escape and run out of the room . After  Sara leaves ,  Adam takes the piece of clay and slits  Adam throat .  Sara runs down the hall while medical aid is applied to  Adam .    Sara eventually collects  Sara and tells  Grissom that when  Sara mother killed  Sara father ,  Sara mother was taken to a place very similar to this hospital .  Grissom offers to take  Sara off the case , but  Sara says  Sara has moved beyond that childhood trauma and insists on finishing the case . Nurse McKay interrupts and blames the CSIs for what happened , telling them that have disrupted the status quo . An angry  Sara fires back and accuses Nurse McKay have having a sexual relationship with  Adam , as her lipstick was found on the boxer shorts . Nurse McKay says that she sometimes let  Adam borrow her lipstick , but  Grissom replies that there was n\\'t any lipstick found on  Adam \\'s body .    Grissom brings the piece of clay  Adam was holding to the art room and finds  Adam \\'s workstation . The therapist tells  Grissom that  Adam was working on a vase but that  Grissom never got to finish it . Before  Grissom could do so , Nurse McKay came in and had an argument with  Adam . She then yanked  Adam out of the class .  Grissom takes a closer look at the vase and confirms that it was on the pottery wheel while the argument was occurring .    Grissom has the vase brought back to the lab . There , acoustic archaeology is used to pull sounds from the grooves in the vase . Sofia plays the audio back and Nurse McKay can be heard saying the name \"  Robbie . \" They listen further and are able to pick up the words \" my angel , \" which  Grissom notes is what  Adam \\'s mother called  Adam in her letters to  Adam .   Nurse McKay is brought in for questioning .  Sara tells  Sara that the DNA from the hairbrush found in  Adam \\'s room is a match to the cigarette butt . Nurse McKay is revealed to be Adam \\'s mother . Six months ago ,  Sara started getting back the letters  Sara sent  Adam . Being registered as a nurse ,  Sara applied to the hospital and got a job there to be closer to  Adam . As time went on ,  Sara would watch  Sara son get closer with  Robbie and knew something had to be done . In the art room ,  Sara told  Adam to end things with  Robbie , but  Adam refused .   Nurse McKay tricked  Robbie into bringing the photo of a young  Adam into group , knowing that taking the photo away from  Adam would set  Adam off and cause an episode .  Robbie was restrained in seclusion and , later that night ,  Robbie went into  Robbie \\'s room and smothered  Robbie with  Robbie pillow .  Robbie then had  Adam cover up the murder by beating  Robbie \\'s head into the floor . Nurse McKay says that none of this can be proven , but  Brass says that the incest alone is a Class B felony punishable for up to ten years in prison . She defiantly tells  Brass that there \\'s no way  Adam will testify against her .   Grissom , who was watching from behind the two - way glass , tells  Sara that Nurse McKay wo n\\'t last six months in prison without her son and that she will die there .  Sara replies that such an outcome would be the best for both of them .']\n",
      "s01e08 ['Synopsis When another staged suicide takes place ,  Grissom realizes  Grissom is dealing with a serial killer who has a thorough knowledge of forensic science . Meanwhile Warrick and Nick investigate a tourist \\'s car that fell off a cliff .   Plot Victim : Stuart Rampler ( deceased )   On the case : Catherine Willows , Gil Grissom , Sara Sidle , Jim Brass    Grissom and Brass are called to a disturbingly familiar crime scene . Stuart Rampler lies dead in a bathtub in an apparent suicide .  Grissom finds a tape recorder nearby and plays the suicide message – aside from having been recorded backwards and changing the personal details to reflect Rampler ’s name and birthday , the message is identical to the recorded message found at the Royce Harmon murder several months ago .  Grissom realizes that the killer has returned .    Sara dusts the bathtub for fingerprints and is surprised to find no prints at all .  Sara then processes Rampler ’s hotel room and finds a pile of mail ready to be sent .  Sara notices that only one of the stamps is upside - down . At the lab , Greg tells  Sara that the DNA on the right - side - up stamps belongs to Rampler , but the upside - down stamp was licked by an unknown person .  Sara says that \" Anonymous \" is toying with the CSIs , leaving them unusual clues and red herrings .   The CSIs analyze the suicide tapes and hear rustling paper . They realize that the killer forces his victims to read the suicide message from a script .    Sara notices that both victims have the same birthday , August 17 , but that Harmon was born in 1958 and Rampler in 1957 .  Grissom mentions that the tape was recorded backwards and that the stamp was upside - down .  Grissom thinks that the killer is suggesting  Grissom look backwards instead of forwards for clues .  Grissom tells  Sara to look at cases from August 17 , 1956 .    Grissom finds two thumbprints on the tape recorder , one on top of the other . The first print belongs as Paul Millander , who has already been cleared as a suspect . The second print , however , is identified as  Grissom’s ’s , and  Grissom’s realizes that \" Whoever it is telling me that  Grissom’s \\'s got me under  Grissom’s thumb . \"  Grissom again visits  Millander to ask if  Grissom kept any records of who bought  Grissom Halloween hands , but  Millander can not help  Grissom .    Brass learns that Rampler has been making  ATM cash withdrawals after  Grissom death .  ATM ATM is brought to the lab , and  Grissom watches the surveillance footage from the security camera . A homeless man holds up cue cards to the camera , showing a message that the killer will kill again and again until he gets justice .  Brass finds the homeless man and questions him .  Brass says a man approached him and offered him $ 100 to hold the cue cards in front of the camera , and he describes a man that  Grissom recognizes as  Millander .  Grissom angrily realizes that  Grissom has been tricked .   Sara learns that  Millander witnessed two men stage  Grissom father ’s suicide when  Grissom was ten years old . The team realizes that  Millander is killing men born on the same day as  Grissom father \\'s death .  Grissom and Catherine go to  Millander ’s warehouse and find it empty , a stark contrast to when  Grissom visited earlier that day when it was full of  Millander \\'s products . The lone remaining item is an envelope addressed to  Grissom . Inside , there is a single piece of paper with nothing written on it .  Grissom interprets this to mean \" we have nothing \" .   As the CSIs search the warehouse ,  Millander visits the lab and waves jauntily at a security camera .   Victim : Walter Banglor ( alive )   On the case : Nick Stokes , Warrick Brown    Warrick and  Nick arrive at their crime scene : a car has fallen off a cliff . They find Walter Banglor unconscious in the back seat but no driver . They also find empty beer bottles nearby and speculate that the driver was drunk . They notice that the car balanced on the edge of the cliff before it fell over .    Nick voices  Nick \" phantom driver \" theory where the driver bailed as the car balanced on the road edge and was then picked up by a second car , whose tracks they have found .  Warrick disagrees and points to nearby footprints which show a walking stride to the edge .  Warrick thinks the man in the backseat was the driver , and  Warrick was robbed . They decide to bet on the case .    Nick and  Warrick visit the man from the backseat in the hospital but can not question him because he is sedated . They inspect him and find tan lines pointing to a missing watch and ring , and an empty wallet .  Nick finds fingerprints on the steering wheel that match  Banglor and blue dust in the ridges of  Nick prints .  Nick finds more blue dust on  Banglor \\'s clothing . Greg tells  Nick the blue dust is chalk used for pool cues .   Again ,  Nick and Warrick compare theories .  Nick thinks  Banglor was playing pool with  Nick phantom driver and the drunk driver crashed the car . The driver got out of the car , leaving his friend in the back seat .  Warrick agrees that  Warrick was drinking and playing pool , but thinks  Warrick was driving alone .  Warrick was flagged down by a man , skidded and hit the railing , balancing on the edge .  Warrick was then robbed , forced into the back seat , and pushed over the edge .  They admit that both scenarios work , and  They must talk to  Banglor to find out what really happened .    Nick and  Warrick are finally able to speak to Banglor , who tells them that  he gambled away all of  he money at a pool hall , including  he watch and ring , and then tried to drive home very drunk .  he crashed and moved into the back seat and buckled  he in .  Nick and  Warrick agree , in terms of the bet , that there is no winner and no loser .']\n",
      "s03e11 ['Synopsis Grissom ,  Catherine and Nick investigate when the chef of a fancy restaurant ends up in a meat grinder . They soon discover a lot more went on in the kitchen than cooking . Meanwhile , Warrick and Sara find out that the apparent suicide of a young woman who suffered from bipolar disorder is actually a murder .   Plot Victim : Petrov Samsko ( deceased )   On the case : Catherine Willows , Gil Grissom , Nick Stokes , Jim Brass   Manny Saldano , a shop foreman for Meteor for eleven years walks into the meat processing plant and turns on the equipment . Before turning on the mean grinder , he notices a human arm with the hand still attached .  Grissom finds the the ulna jammed in the grinder , which is probably why the killer did n\\'t finish the job .    Catherine and  Grissom note that there is blood everywhere , so their usual CSI chemicals are n\\'t going to help them .  Catherine disassembles part of the meat grinder and is able to remove the ulna . Meanwhile ,  Grissom finds an earplug on the ground .  Grissom says that ear wax contains a lot of DNA and that the ear plug  Grissom found is different from the ones the workers wear .   Doc Robbins has the hand propped up and tells  Grissom that the victim was dead when their arm was cut off . There is scar tissue on the palm , which Doc Robbins says  Grissom sees a lot with laborers ( bricklayers , carpenters , etc . ) .  Grissom takes a sample from under the fingernails and says  Grissom will send it to trace . Although the fingers are worn to the bone ,  Grissom applies a ridge builder application to temporarily make the prints visible again for lifting and tracing .    Catherine and  Grissom run the print and find that it belongs to Petrov Samsko . Petrov had a non - gaming sherriff \\'s permit and was also was a head chef of DeBreff Restaurant , a five - star restaurant .  Grissom realizes that a chef could get  Grissom palm burned at work .   They visit the fancy restaurant and inform the hostess that Petrov has been found dead and dismembered .  Catherine talks to the restaurant \\'s owner , Les Dutton , and informs him that there were traces of aspic and olive oil under Petrov \\'s fingernails . This indicates that he might have been murdered in the kitchen and brought to the meat grinder without showering .  Grissom finds a uniform with blood spatter on it , but  Les indicates that chef \\'s use knives and cut themselves often . The uniform , however , belongs to a waitress named Stephanie and the blood is on the back of the shirt .    Les wants them to wait until after the dinner rush before they close the kitchen and start processing . However ,  Catherine and  Grissom notice that the \" rush \" is taking way too long .  Grissom spots a table with flowers ; when  Grissom removes the flowers ,  Grissom finds a V - shaped pattern on the wall .  Grissom says the pattern is likely too big to be from a burning candle . When  Grissom asks  Les what the mark is from ,  Grissom replies it is likely from the wait staff putting a candle too close to the wall .   In the kitchen ,  Catherine and  Grissom attempt to talk to Stephanie , but  Catherine is still busy bringing food out to the tables .  Catherine informs Ross Halpo , a sous chef , that they found blood spatter on several uniforms from the night  Petrov died . The blood was found on the uniforms worn by Stephanie , Ross , and Lola Creighton , the saucier .  Ross says that the blood is  Ross ; while preparing food  Ross accidentally touched  Petrov \\'s knife and  Petrov sliced  Ross \\'s finger .  Ross explains that this is the \" chef \\'s code , \" while  Lola adds that if someone gets cut in the kitchen they act macho disperse the blood to create \" maximum spillage . \"  Grissom says that the CSI team is taking over the ktichen .    Catherine and  Nick examine the kitchen , where  Nick finds seminal fluid and  Catherine finds a substance that tests positive for cocaine . Meanwhile ,  Grissom finds the presence of blood around the drain .  Catherine notes that there was blood , semen , and cocaine in the kitchen - the only thing not going on was cooking .  Grissom opens the drain and finds something that looks like sand attached to a blood clot .  Grissom notes that the blood is not from a knife nick ; it sat long enough to pool and clot .  Grissom then asks to see everyone \\'s knives , starting with Ross .   While looking through the kitchen some more ,  Grissom uncovers a guéridon , which is used for tableside cooking and could explain the V - shaped burn pattern on the wall  Grissom found earlier .  Grissom remarks to  Les that a guéridon is illegal since the 70 \\'s due to potential injuries to patrons , but the V - shaped mark on the wall is recent .  Grissom goes through the owner \\'s log and notes that Danny Pasquale , a male model , suffered third - degree burns to  Grissom face .  Les admits that they do special requests and that is how the accident happened . However ,  Les says that  Danny never filed formal charges against  Les or the restaurant .   In the interrogation room ,  Brass suggests that  Danny did n\\'t file charges because  Danny wanted to take care of it  Danny .  Grissom notices a bite mark , or \" fight bite , \" on the back of  Danny \\'s right hand .  Grissom notes that human mouths are full of bacteria and can cause infections .  Brass suggests  Danny fought  Petrov in retaliation for what happened to  Petrov face . When  Danny does n\\'t say anything ,  Grissom tells  Danny  Danny does n\\'t have to . All  Danny needs to do is swab the bite mark on  Danny \\'s hand .   A doctor removes fluid from  Danny \\'s wound . Meanwhile ,  Catherine has tested 25 knives for  Petrov \\'s blood with each coming back negative .  Catherine finally finds what  Catherine thinks is blood on a knife only to realize it is n\\'t . Elsewhere , Greg gives  Grissom the test results - the DNA found on  Danny \\'s hand came from  Petrov \\'s mouth . It would appear that  Danny punched  Petrov in the mouth .    Grissom is interrogating  Danny when  Brass gets  Grissom attention . The DNA from the ear plug found earlier came back to Harold Haskins , a delivery man for Meteor who has violated  Grissom parole . As it turns out ,  Harold delivered to the same restaurant  Petrov worked at .  Brass interrogates Harold , who says  Harold got the \" meat \" from the restaurant freezer and brought it to the meat grinder . When  Brass threatens to tell  Harold \\'s parole officer what \\'s going on ,  Harold admits that  Ross had  Harold dispose of the body .  Harold owed  Ross $ 3,000 for cocaine and  Ross had  Harold repay the debt by doing  Harold a favor .   In the restaurant kitchen ,  Ross denies any involvement in killing  Petrov .  Catherine says that nobody else is talking ; it \\'s what the military calls \" code red \" - fierce loyalty to the man in charge .  Catherine points out that  Petrov used to be at the top before  Petrov was murdered .  Grissom finds what looks like wool and claims that someone was cooking something that was n\\'t food .   Greg tells  Catherine that the red mark on the knife that  Catherine mistook for blood was actually nail polish . In the interrogation room ,  Catherine lines up the four female workers from the restaurant and looks at their nails .  Catherine hostess has marks on  Catherine nails .  Catherine removes one of the press - on nails and gives it to  Catherine for evidence while the other three women are released .   In the lab , new lab tech David Hodges tells  Grissom that the wool found is used in high - end suits . Hodges also tells  Grissom that there was blood found on the wool that belonged to  Petrov , and that someone burned a high - end suit in the kitchen .   Back in the interrogation room ,  Catherine interviews  Catherine hostess .  Catherine tells  Catherine hostess that the nail polish collected matched the nail polish found on the knife .  Catherine believes the nail polish got transferred while  Catherine hostess was stabbing  Petrov . For the time being ,  Catherine is not charged with any crime .   In the evidence room ,  Grissom is testing the knife when  Catherine enters .  Grissom shakes the knife and it makes a sound that nobody picked up on earlier . Upon twisting to open the handle ,  Grissom finds sand , which  Catherine says is for balance and precision .  Grissom notes that the sand is volcanic sand , and  Catherine notes that  Catherine \\'s seen the same sand before on the blood clot found in the kitchen \\'s drain . Under a magnifying glass ,  Grissom sees blood on the handle of the knife where it twists open .   In one interrogation room ,  Grissom presents  Ross  Grissom own kitchen knife and says  Grissom does n\\'t believe  Grissom killed Petrov , but  Grissom did fillet him . The knife twisted open while this was being done , causing sand to fall down the drain . In another interrogation room ,  Catherine interviews  Les , who  Catherine claims knew about the murder and helped cover it up . While  Ross got rid of Petrov \\'s body ,  Les burned  Ross own suit to get rid of the evidence .    Brass talks to  Grissom and  Brass agree that nobody is talking . However ,  Brass has a plan .  Brass enters  Catherine \\'s interrogation room and whispers something to  Catherine , then takes  Les for a walk . The same thing is done with  Ross . As both men are being walked down the hallway , they pass  Catherine hostess and stare at  Catherine , for it looks like  Catherine is n\\'t being charged with any crime .  Catherine stares back with a puzzled look , unsure of what \\'s going on .  Grissom is watching this happen and notices  Catherine reaction .  Grissom walks up to  Catherine and asks  Catherine why  Catherine killed Petrov .    Catherine hostess explains that  Catherine walked into the kitchen for lemons and saw  Petrov having sex with  Lola . Petrov would play around with women all the time , but doing so with  Lola crossed the line since  Lola was a chef .  Catherine wonders that since  Catherine ca n\\'t make toast , where did  Catherine stand in Petrov \\'s eyes ?  Catherine admits to stabbing  Petrov , while  Ross and  Les covered everything up to help \" protect the kitchen . \"   Victim : Linda Damon ( deceased )   On the case : Sara Sidle , Warrick Brown , Dale Sulik   Det .

Linda was dating Brody Jones , but EMT Hank Peddigrew says nobody knows where  Brody works or lives .  Warrick asks Hank if the body was moved , and Hank says they only had to prop the body up while checking for vitals and/or life - saving actions .  Sara responds by calling Hank \" baby \" then admonishes  Sara .  Warrick notes that  Linda bled out and died in two different spots .   In  Linda \\'s closet ,  Sara finds a white shirt with blue stains on it . The stains are cool to the touch . Meanwhile ,  Warrick finds bloody shoeprints on the carpet , indicating  Linda \\'s death might not be a suicide .    Warrick checks the shoes of  Linda \\'s parents , but finds no match .  John says that  Brody was a gambler and would keep  Linda out late at night visiting different casinos .  Linda \\'s mother , Jane , says  Linda had a tough time finding  Linda after college , but  Linda was getting better .   In autopsy , Doc Robbins tells  Sara that the transection of the left wrist is consistent with a self - inflicted wound , especially since  Linda was left - handed .  Sara sees that there are no hesitation marks , which  Sara believes is unusual for a suicide .  Sara says that nothing with the case adds up and that the body was two feet away from where it bled out . Doc Robbins has not received the toxicology screen yet .  Sara sees that there is glass in  Linda \\'s hair and notes that they did n\\'t find any broken glass in  Sara apartment . The glass is polarized and tinted with round edges ; Doc Robbins guesses that it could be safety glass .    Sara talks to Hodges , who confirms that the glass is polarized and is from a car windshield .  Sara wonders whether  Linda was in a car accident , but Hodges wonders why  Sara would go home and commit suicide afterwards . Hodges can not provide a make of the car , but narrows it down to a 2002 model .    Sara and  Warrick head to the apartment \\'s parking garage and find the windshield of  Linda \\'s car intact . They come across a car that looks like it had it \\'s windshield recently replaced . The owner of the car claims that  Linda was responsible for damaging the old windshield and that  Linda never paid for the damage  Linda caused throughout the complex . This ranged from damaging mailboxes to throwing patio furniture into the pool . The neighbor says  Linda destroyed the windshield because  Linda \" heard \" the neighbor talking on  Linda cell phone about  Linda .  Warrick informs  Linda that  Linda died the day before via suicide , and the neighbor says she \\'s surprised someone did n\\'t kill her .  Sara and  Warrick glare back at  Sara . After the neighbor leaves , they conclude that they need to get a hold of  Linda \\'s toxicology report .    Linda \\'s parents give  Sara a picture of  Linda and  Brody together .  Sara asks  Sara if the footprint in the bedroom matched  Brody , but  Sara tells  Sara they \\'re not sure yet .  Sara then informs the parents that  Sara spoke to one of  Linda \\'s neighbors who described  Linda as \" troubled . \"  Sara says  Linda had been diagnosed as bipolar  Sara junior year of college and was prescribed lithium .  John admits that they knew  Linda was destructive in  Linda complex and that  Linda moods would swing from up to down . When  Linda was \" up , \"  Linda did n\\'t think  Linda needed the lithium , which would make  Linda more unstable .   With help from Det . Sulik ,  Sara and  Warrick find  Brody at a casino slot machine writing down the results of each spin .  Warrick spots blood on the right sleeve of  Brody \\'s shirt .  Brody does n\\'t want to be bothered , as  Brody is trying to crack the pattern of the slot machine .  Brody gives them  Brody shirt when asked , but continues to play . The CSIs finally have enough and drag  Brody away to the police station .   In the interrogation room ,  Warrick informs  Brody that  Warrick footprint matches the one found in  Linda \\'s blood and that it \\'s  Linda \\'s blood on  Warrick shirt .  Brody , however , is more concerned that  someone is playing the slot machine  someone was pulled away from , wiping out 72 hours of  someone hard work . When pressed ,  Brody admits to entering  Linda \\'s apartment to take money for gambling .  Brody thought  Linda was asleep until  Brody spotted the blood and tried to revive  Linda .  Warrick asks  Brody why  Warrick left  Linda \\'s body there and did n\\'t call the police ;  Brody responds by saying that  Brody is the son of God and that  Brody can only do so much .  Warrick figures out that both  Brody and  Linda are bipolar and that they may have stopped taking their lithium together .   Outside of the interrogation room ,  Warrick talks to  Sara and they agree that  Brody may be too high to even realize what happened . Doc Robbins stops by and hands Warrick Linda \\'s toxicology results . There was no lithium in  Linda \\'s system , but there was a huge dose of  Valium ingested less than an hour before  Linda time of death .  Sara notes that  Valium is the last thing a depressed person would take .  Warrick says that there were 200 mg in  Linda \\'s system , more than five times the normal dosage .  Sara realizes that  Linda would have been in no condition to fight back if someone was attacking  Linda with a weapon .   Det . Sulik informs  Sara and  Warrick that  Linda did not have a prescription for  Valium ; however ,  Linda mother does .  Warrick interviews Jane Damon in  Linda home and  Sara confirms that  Linda takes Valium in order to deal with  Linda . The prescription was refilled a few days ago .  Sara and  Warrick accuse  Sara of drugging Linda , which  Sara vehemently denies , while  John says they are out of line . Greg calls  Sara and tells  Sara that the substance found on the shirt from the closet was biological with a high salt content - tears .  Sara hangs up and informs the Damon \\'s that the tears found on the blouse had male DNA .    John says that the only way to get someone psychological help is if  they hurt  they or someone else .  John explains that  Linda was out of hand , attacking strangers and vandalizing property .  Linda refused to take  Linda medication and  Linda parents could n\\'t force  Linda to .  John admits to slicing  Linda \\'s wrist to make it look like a suicide attempt . When  John heard someone ( Brody ) at the door ,  John hid the knife and hid in the closet .  Brody tried to save  Linda , but it was too late .  John tearfully explains that  John just wanted to get  Linda help , while  John wife ignores  John .

As the body is removed from the school ,  Catherine and Warrick stop a janitor from removing the graffiti from the locker ;  Grissom claims that  it \\'s school policy to remove  it immediately , but they point out that it \\'s part of a crime scene and will call the Sheriff if  Grissom does n\\'t stop .    Brass talks to the football coach and asks if kids were normally in the school after hours ; the coach says that it was okay for kids to be in the school after practice until the school was locked up around 8 or 8:30 p.m.  Grissom , examining the bathroom , finds a slug in the wall , which gives  Grissom a point of reference for where the shooter was .    Grissom is still in the school bathroom ,  Catherine and Warrick come in to photograph the scene and find an orange finger print on the wall .  Catherine says that this paint is from another source , and  Catherine \\'ll find out who had it .  Grissom and Warrick use the shot from the wall to determine that the shooter was standing in the last stall , and was about five foot three or four .    Catherine talks to Julia Barrett , the school counselor , who tells  Catherine that the spray painted locker belongs to Dennis Fram .  Catherine tells  Catherine that  Catherine ca n\\'t keep track of every move that the kids make , and is n\\'t sure if  Grissom locker has been spray painted before . In the bathroom , Warrick is using an expensive new toy to test the area where the shooter stood for scents left behind ;  Grissom gives him a glass tube and an air pump to use instead , and tells him that it costs 10 dollars instead of thousands .    Catherine tells  Grissom about the locker victim , saying that Dennis Fram is slight , non - violent and  Barry always picked on him . They go to Ms. Barrett \\'s office to talk to  Catherine about  Dennis , but  Catherine sees the janitor and tells  Grissom that  Catherine \\'ll catch up to him after  Catherine talks to the janitor .    Grissom finds out from  Dennis that  Grissom \\'s five - three , and that  Grissom \\'s washed  Grissom hands since the time that  Barry \\'s body was discovered , but  Grissom has n\\'t changed  Grissom shirt .  Grissom sprays  Grissom shirt , which then turns blue , and  Grissom explains that it \\'s gun shot residue , which plumes back on the hands and clothes when a gun is fired .  Grissom tells  Dennis that  Grissom \\'s fired a gun within the last few hours , and that the police will want to talk to  Grissom .  Dennis admits to  Brass that  Dennis went to target practice ;  Dennis says that  Dennis sister goes there with  Dennis , and that  Dennis does n\\'t have a gun ,  Dennis rents one at the range .  Dennis sister Kelsey comes in and accuses  them of harassing  Dennis ; Ms. Barrett tells  them that  Dennis has explained things and that  Dennis sister will vouch for  Dennis whereabouts and points out as well that  Dennis \\'s a minor .   In the school bathroom ,  Warrick tells  Catherine that  Warrick new toy has been down , and shows  Catherine the glass jar that  Grissom has  Grissom using instead .  Catherine asks why  Warrick needed something so expensive , and  Warrick says because it was cool .   Doc Robbins tells  Grissom that Barry Shickle had three bullets in  Grissom and the third one pierced  Grissom heart ;  Grissom also notes that  Barry was attacked recently , sometime within the last six months , and would have been stabbed in the heart , if  Grissom heart had been there , but  Grissom dextrocardia saved  Grissom ;  Grissom comments that  Grissom \\'s like Dr. No , with  Grissom heart on the right side of  Grissom body instead of the left . Doc Robbins says that the stabbing was something that was done in hand - to - hand fighting ;  Grissom says that that does n\\'t sound like something that Dennis Fram would do .   Ms. Barrett asks  Grissom if he \\'s spoken to  Barry \\'s parents ;  Grissom tells her that they did n\\'t know that  Barry had been stabbed six months ago . Ms. Barrett says that  Barry was popular , but a bully , and there are probably a dozen kids in the school who would like to see  Barry dead .  Grissom interviews those kids , who tell  Barry about what  Barry did to them on a daily basis ; one admits that  Grissom stabbed  Barry with a fork about six months ago , and then says that this is the first time  Grissom \\'s been able to come to school and not feel like a target ; however ,  Grissom has an alibi for the time of death :  Grissom was at boxing practice . After all the interviews , Ms. Barrett explains to  Grissom that she can protect the kids against being called certain names , but everything else is free speech ;  Grissom tells her that  Grissom does n\\'t blame her , but she blames herself .  Grissom asks her if she knows who did this , and she tells  Grissom that  Grissom does n\\'t know what it \\'s like , being in school these days .    Nick and Warrick talk about being in school ;  Catherine comes in and  Warrick comments that  Catherine was a bully in school ;  Nick says that  Nick was \\' dependable \\' in high school , and Warrick says that  Nick was unpopular .  Catherine comes in with news of \\' liquid - man \\' for  Nick and tells them that  Catherine was a science nerd in high school .  Catherine and  Nick leave ;  Catherine and  Warrick continue talking ;  Warrick tells  Catherine that  Warrick was short , with big feet and thick glasses , and got pushed around by the guys and ignored by the girls .  Catherine asks if  they did n\\'t even notice  Warrick eyes , as  they \\'re  Warrick best feature .  Warrick tells  Catherine that  Warrick can see both sides of the case ;  it \\'s not right that  Barry got shot , but  Barry can kind of understand  it .    Catherine tests different spray paints on lockers and tests to see how quickly they dry .  Warrick runs tests on the scents that  Warrick collected in the bathroom , and tells  Grissom that there are a lot of chemical components present : bubblegum , cigars , marijuana ... just like every guy \\'s bathroom .    Grissom runs tests ,  Brass checked out the kids , none were there when  Barry was shot ; except  Dennis .  Catherine says that  Catherine can put  Dennis at the scene ;  Catherine and  Brass go to talk to the Frams ; they tell them that their son was there when  Barry was shot , and that the finger print on the locker is  Barry as well , and that proves that  Barry was there because the spray paint dries in 30 seconds , so  Barry was at the locker immediately after  Barry spray painted it , and followed  Barry into the bathroom .  Catherine tells them that the school janitor keeps records of all vandalism , this is how  Catherine knows the times .  Dennis starts to cry , and  Dennis sister  Kelsey comes out to comfort  Dennis .    Warrick finds the one smell that does n\\'t belong in a guys \\' bathroom ;  Grissom tells  Warrick that  Warrick wants to use the new toy to identify the smell , but just the software from it .    Kelsey gives  Dennis some medicine and takes care of  Dennis while  Catherine watches ;  Catherine then tells  Catherine that  Dennis has a bleeding ulcer because of what  Barry did to  Barry , and that it was hard for  Dennis to work up the courage just to go to school every day ;  Catherine thought  Dennis was going to kill  Dennis .  Catherine looks at  Kelsey and asks how tall  Catherine is ;  Catherine \\'s five - foot four with heels ;  Catherine says  Catherine has no reason for asking .   In the lab ,  Grissom identifies the scent as a floral perfume , then gets the brand :  Chanteuse .  Warrick is surprised that it can be narrowed down to just one brand , and  Grissom tells  Warrick that this is where the technology came from in the first place ; perfume companies .  Catherine calls in and says that  Catherine has a new suspect and it \\'s not who they think , but  Grissom knows that  Catherine means  Kelsey and says that  Catherine should get a warrant for  Kelsey \\'s perfume .    Brass asks  Kelsey where  Catherine was the night that  Barry was shot ;  Catherine says that  Catherine was just driving around .  Catherine tells them that  Catherine mother used to wear Chanteuse , and after she died in a car accident , she started to wear it .  Grissom and  Warrick tell  Kelsey that they found traces of  Catherine perfume in the bathroom ;  Catherine comments that it \\'s a high - end perfume and not one that many high school girls wear . Mr. Fram stops the interview saying that  Barry dogged them while  Barry was alive and now  Barry \\'s doing it from the grave .  Catherine wonders where the perfume is , as they ca n\\'t find it in the home .   At the station ,  Dennis tells  Catherine and  Grissom that anything  Dennis sister did was to protect  Dennis ;  Dennis says that  Dennis went back to the school to get a book that  Dennis \\'d forgotten , that  Dennis was n\\'t looking for  Barry ,  Dennis just had to go to the bathroom . When  Dennis got there ,  Dennis saw the shooting ;  Dennis tells them that now  Dennis dad is freaking out and  Dennis sister wo n\\'t come out of her room .  Catherine notes that  Dennis has n\\'t said that  Dennis saw  Kelsey shoot  Barry .  Brass comes in and asks  Catherine if  Dennis admitted anything , then tells  Catherine that  Kelsey has an alibi ;  Catherine got a ticket in an alley behind a motel on Fremont Street , and a lot of people got tickets that night , including Jeremy Spencer , the football coach at the school .  Brass says that  Brass \\'s spoken to Jeremy Spencer , and  Brass \\'s willing to testify that  Kelsey gave  Brass a roll in the hay in exchange for  Brass getting  Barry to stop bullying  Kelsey brother .  Grissom asks  Dennis why  Grissom thinks that  Kelsey shot  Barry ;  Dennis says that the last time that  Barry beat  Brass up ,  Kelsey said that  Kelsey \\'d take care of it , and  Kelsey always keeps  Kelsey promises .  Grissom adds that  Grissom smelled  Kelsey perfume in the bathroom , and that \\'s how  Grissom knew it was  Kelsey .  Grissom points out that it was just  Kelsey brand of perfume , not necessarily her .    Grissom talks to Ms. Barrett , and tells her that they recovered a bottle of  Chanteuse perfume from  Chanteuse townhouse , as well as a gun , which had n\\'t been cleaned .  Chanteuse tells him that  Chanteuse does n\\'t know how to clean  it , as it was  Chanteuse husband \\'s ;  Grissom points out that  Chanteuse knows how to shoot  it . Ms. Barrett tells  Grissom that she was worried about how long it was going to be before one of the kids came to school and opened fire in a hallway , and she thought that one life was better than 20 or 30 .  Grissom adds , \" Or 11 . \"  Grissom tells her that  Grissom checked her record , and knows that she was the Vice Principal at a high school where there was a shooting that killed 11 students ;  Grissom tells her that she \\'s suffering post - traumatic stress , and that she should tell her lawyer that .  Grissom then says that as difficult as high school is for kids , eventually , it \\'s over .  Grissom leaves , and officers come in and arrest her .   Victim : William Cartson ( deceased )   On the case : Nick Stokes , Sara Sidle , Ray O\\'Riley   A helicopter flies over the desert , they have a visual , and approach the site .  Nick and  Catherine are inside ; they descend on ropes and meet an Emergency Services worker who tells them that there \\'s a dead body in a bag . He says that no one has touched it ; they hook it up and take it back up to the helicopter .    Nick and Sara X - ray the bag ,  David tells them that  David likes to put off opening the bag when it \\'s a decomposing corpse ; they see a coin in the x - ray which  David says is a silver dollar , as well as a medical pin and a plate in the skull .  David shakes the bag and says that it sounds like  David \\'s been dead for two months .   David Phillips tells  Nick and  Catherine to breathe through their mouths , and then pulls body parts out of the decomp bag ; the body is in pieces , and there \\'s also the silver dollar and a gambling chip , as well as a jacket , and bones .  Catherine comments that there are no organs left ;  David dumps the bag , and a soupy mess comes out .  Catherine takes the jacket to see what  Catherine can get from it ;  David tells them that  David wants to finish with the body quickly because a decomp can stink up the whole building forever .  Nick and  Catherine go out into the hall ;  Grissom sees them and suggests lemons for the smell ;  Catherine looks back into the morgue and sees  David hosing down the table . In an evidence storehouse , an officer writes the name \" John Doe \" on a card and puts it in the front of a box holding the personal effects of the body from the bag , and files it among other boxes .    Catherine cleans the jacket and finds a name tag with the name \" W. Cartson \" on it .  Nick comments that homeless guys buy these types of jackets in surplus stores all the time .  Nick pulls something out of the pocket of the jacket , and the smell makes  Catherine sick ;  Catherine asks  Nick not to tell anyone . Hank Peddigrew arrives and asks  Catherine to have lunch with him ;  Catherine comments that  Catherine smells bad , but he tries to assure  Catherine that it \\'s not that bad , but then has to go outside to get away from the smell . Greg walks by and tells  Catherine that a real man would n\\'t mind the smell .   In the lab , Ronnie works on the match book that  Nick pulled out of \\' liquid man \\'s \\' pocket ;  Nick uses a computer to add pixels to it , and comes up with the name Romanini \\'s , which  Nick says  Nick knows ; it \\'s a night club off the Strip .  O\\'Riley comes in with the identification of the body ; the name tag was correct ,  O\\'Riley was William Cartson , a Second Lieutenant who was wounded in action and had a pin put in and a plate in  O\\'Riley head 31 years ago , and was never heard from again . They head out to the night club .   At the night club , O\\'Riley ,  Catherine and  Nick talk to the owner and ask if he knows William Cartson ; he says that he does n\\'t .  Nick says that  Nick was down on  Nick luck , and the owner then says they must mean  Moses , and tells them that  Moses was homeless and was scaring the customers and ruining  Moses business .  Moses says that  Moses tried to reason with  Moses , but \\'  Moses \\' would n\\'t go , so  Moses gave  Moses a casino chip and told  Moses to move on .  Moses says that was about two months ago .  Catherine comments that  Cartson has been dead about two months ;  they ask the owner to take a ride to the station with  they .    Catherine talks to the night club owner and he admits that he gave \\'  Moses \\' a ride , but says that he left  Moses on the side of the road .  Catherine asks if maybe he zipped him up in a bag ;  Catherine shows him the bag that  Cartson was in ; the owner tells them that \\'  Moses \\' was drunk , so  Moses put him in the bag and then kicked him down the hill , figuring that he \\'d get out when he woke up .  O\\'Riley tells him that he \\'s being arrested for homicide .    Catherine showers and tries to get the smell of decomposition off of  Catherine .  Nick goes to the John Doe box and pulls it out , writes a new card for the front that says Lt . Wm .  Cartson , puts  Cartson on the box and replaces it .   ----    Grissom does paperwork and fills in forms for the electronic nose , and puts it in an envelope for a federal grant to pay for it .  Catherine comes in and gives  Grissom a stamp to put on the envelope ; Warrick walks by and sees what  Grissom is doing , and smiles .']\n",
      "s02e10 ['Synopsis When  Grissom has to go to a conference , and Catherine is off to Reno ,  Grissom leaves Warrick in charge of the graveyard shift \\'s investigation of the murder of a con man . Things get personal for Brass when he learns his estranged daughter Ellie is one of the suspects .   Plot Victim : Vincent Avery ( deceased )   On the case : Nick Stokes , Sara Sidle , Warrick Brown , Jim Brass , Sam Vega    Cindy distressed man named Vincent Avery stops a vacationing couple ,  Matt and Cindy Orton , on the  Vegas strip .  Cindy claims  Cindy \\'s been banned from the casino , but has $ 10,000 in chips  Cindy needs to cash in .  Cindy asks the couple if they can go in and cash the chips , but seems untrusting of them .  Cindy says they are trustworthy and they give  Cindy a $ 2,000 deposit in good faith .  Cindy man with the chips says  Cindy \\'ll give them the money back plus another $ 1,000 when they cash the chips in . However , the cashier in the casino informs  Matt that chips are fakes . As they run out of the casino , they hear a gunshot from the nearby parking garage and a car speeding away .    Brass and  Grissom arrive on the scene and  Brass informs  Cindy that the deceased was running one of the oldest scams in  Vegas .  Cindy would have gotten away with it if the getaway driver did n\\'t shoot  Cindy in the head and speed off . There are no surveillance cameras in the garage , but  Grissom spots fresh tire marks and an oil slick on the garage floor . The deceased also has the Orton \\'s money , which is now evidence .   In the lab ,  Grissom informs  Catherine that  Grissom heading to a conference in Duluth along with  Grissom cockroaches , which  Grissom will race for fun .  Catherine is named the temporary supervisor , but  Catherine is heading to Reno to be Sam Braun \\'s date at the opening of a new casino .  Grissom names  Warrick the temporary supervisor , as  Grissom knowledge of gambling would be best utilized on the murder at the casino .  Grissom is unhappy with the assignment , especially after finding out that  Grissom did n\\'t let  Nick and  Sara know that  Warrick would be in charge .   At the crime scene in the parking garage ,  Nick photographs the tire treads while  Sara finds a small film canister under a car . The canister is filled with mysterious black pills .  Warrick arrives , making sure everything is running smoothly .  Sara reacts negatively when  Sara finds out  Warrick has been named supervisor for the night .    Warrick speaks to Doc Robbins , who has identified the victim as Vincent Thomas Avery . Vincent was shot through the left ear ;  Warrick surmises that he knew the driver and was shot right after he got in the car to get away . X - rays show the bullet lodged in Vincent \\'s skull , but they also show something in his stomach . Doc Robbins opens him up to find about 50 balloons filled with cocaine and covered in a green substance , which is likely jell - o . The jell - o was used to make it easier to swallow the drugs .  Warrick questions why someone acting as a drug mule would be wasting their time on a small - time scan involving fake casino chips .   Brass informs Nick that Thomas Avery had a long rap sheet that includes petty larceny . Nick is looking over the photos of the tire tracks and notices a void in one of them , possibly from a nail .  Greg runs a test on the pills  Sara found ; the result comes back as coal , wood , and coconut shells . The pills are basically charcoal pills that are used to absorb impurities in the body ;  these would help prevent a drug mule from overdosing on the drugs  these were transporting .  Sara lets  Warrick know  Sara found airline stubs in  Vincent \\'s shirt pocket , one for  Vincent and one for a Ellie Rebecca .  Warrick is unhappy  Sara did this without letting  Warrick know . Since  Warrick is in charge ,  Warrick is responsible for processing the evidence .  Greg makes up an excuse to leave the room , as the two get into a minor argument about protocol for the evening .    Warrick runs the prints from the airline ticket and is shocked to find that one comes back as Ellie Rebecca Brass , Jim \\'s daughter .  Warrick lets  Brass know and says  Warrick has to bring  Sara in .  Brass says that that \\'s the job of the police and assigns Det . Vega to bring  Ellie in . In the police station ,  Ellie spots  Ellie father . Instead of walking up  Warrick and greeting  Warrick warmly ,  Ellie spits on  Warrick badge .  Brass asks  Ellie if  Brass \\'re going to pick up where  Brass left off .    Ellie is running prints on every bill Vincent Avery had on him when he died .  Ellie notices a lack of engraving on Ben Franklin \\'s collar on one of the $ 100 bills . In the interrogation room ,  Warrick is interviewing  Ellie .  Ellie says that every man  Ellie sleeps with ends up dead .  Ellie claims that  Ellie barely knew  Vincent , but was willing to fly to  Baja with  Vincent for the weekend . As  Ellie goes to take cigarettes out of  Ellie purse , a fake $ 500 chip falls out . Despite the evidence implicating  Ellie with  Vincent \\'s murder ,  Ellie claims  Ellie was at home when it happened . As  Ellie gets up to leave , Det .  Vega yells at  Ellie to sit back down .  Warrick tells  Ellie that they need to take x - rays of  Ellie , to which  Ellie responds by flirting with  Warrick .  Ellie also says  Ellie lent  Ellie car to  Ellie boyfriend , Keith Driscoll .    Warrick lets  Brass know that the evidence is piling up against  Ellie , but  Brass denies  Ellie involvement in the murder .  Warrick says  Warrick knows  Warrick daughter well enough to know that the shooter is probably Keith . Meanwhile , with help from Ronnie ,  Ellie finds out that one of the bills the Orton \\'s handed to  Vincent was a fake - the words \" United States of America \" are blurred out around Ben Franklin \\'s collar and the ink is black , not green .  Ellie \\'s x - rays come back clean and  Ellie celebrates by flirting with  Warrick more .    Warrick does n\\'t think  Warrick can handle the case and wants to call Grissom , but Nick stops  Warrick . Meanwhile ,  Ellie calls  Brass and has knowledge of what is going on .  Ellie tells  Brass to be careful and not go at it alone . As  Brass call ends , a red Camaro speeds out in front of  Brass \\'s patrol car ; its plates match  Ellie \\'s . After a short chase ,  Brass uses the P.I.T. maneuver to stop the Camaro .  Warrick busts the driver \\'s side window and asks the two men in the car which one is Keith Driscoll . The passenger says  Warrick was just hitchhiking and  Brass tells  Warrick to get lost . When pressed by  Brass ,  Keith says  Ellie is the one who turned  Warrick onto cocaine and drug trafficking . Brass pulls out  Warrick gun but puts it back in  Warrick holster as cops arrive for backup . Det .  Vega approaches Keith , who says that  Brass pulled a gun on  Warrick .  Keith refuses to drive to the police station with Brass ;  Vega agrees . As  Keith walks to  Keith car ,  Vega stares at  Brass ;  Brass does the same in return .    Sara meets with the Orton \\'s at their hotel pool . Matt Orton admits to knowing one of the bills was fake . He tried using it at a gas station and exchanging it and his local bank branch , but could n\\'t get rid of it in either case .  Sara tells  Matt that it is a federal law that knowingly passing along bad money is punishable to up to 15 years in prison .  Sara shows the Orton \\'s a $ 20 bill and notes that there is a shadow of Andrew Jackson \\'s portrait on the right side of the bill .  Sara lets  them know that a Secret Service agent will be coming to speak to  them , as well .   In the police station ,  Warrick meets Special Agent Beckman from the Treasury Department .  Warrick is surprised to learn that there is a federal counterfeiting case at play and that  Warrick was not informed by  Ellie . As  Sara is talking to Warrick , Nick tells  Warrick that  Ellie \\'s car is ready in the garage and that they can not hold  Keith for more than a half hour .  Warrick is angry with  Sara for withholding information , and  Sara tells  Warrick  Sara does it with  Grissom all the time .  Warrick snaps back that  Warrick is not  Grissom .  Warrick tells  Sara to brief Special Agent  Beckman on the counterfeit money and goes with Nick to the garage .   In the garage , Nick and  Warrick find that the tire treads on  Ellie \\'s car match the treads found in the casino parking garage . The rear left tire has a plug in it matching the void Nick found earlier , proving that  Ellie \\'s car was the getaway car used in the murder . In the interrogation room ,  Det .  Vega tells  Keith that the car  Keith was driving was present at Vincent \\'s murder twelve hours before . It is also revealed that  Keith \\'s credit card was the one used to buy the airline tickets to  Baja for Vincent and  Ellie .  Keith \\'s lawyer responds by asking about  Brass pulling his gun on  Keith , much the surprise of  Warrick .  Vega says it was done as a safety precaution . With no other evidence ,  Keith and  Keith lawyer leave .    Sara tells Special Agent Beckman that the Orton \\'s are running a high - end counterfeiting operation . Instead of using the same serial number on each counterfeit bill , they are printing bills but engraving different serial numbers on them to avoid detection .  Beckman replies by saying that the Orton \\'s real identities are the Duffy \\'s . They are from Las Vegas County and they have both spent time for interstate fraud and high - end counterfeiting .  Beckman takes the fake money and vows to shut down the counterfeiting operation .  Ellie says the investigation is not done and tags along with  Beckman .    Warrick informs  Brass that the tire tracks on  Ellie car match the ones from the crime scene .  Brass continues to maintain that Keith Driscoll is the murderer , but  Warrick tells  Warrick they had to let  Warrick go after it was revealed  Brass pulled  Warrick gun on  Warrick .  Warrick says  Vega thinks  Ellie will eventually rat out  Keith , but  Brass tells  Keith that it will never happen , as  Keith knows  Ellie too well .    Brass returns to  Brass office to find  Ellie there . When  Ellie asks if  Ellie \\'s under arrest ,  Brass says that  Brass will bail  Ellie out and offer  Ellie a place to stay .  Ellie replies that  Ellie already shares a place with  Keith .  Brass tells  Ellie that  Ellie is better than all of this ;  Ellie replies that  Ellie really is n\\'t .    Warrick is in  Grissom \\'s office going over paperwork when the phone rings .  Det .  Vega is on the other end and informs  Warrick that there has been a 444 - an officer - involved shooting .  Vega gives  Vega one guess as to who is involved . When Nick and  Warrick arrive at  Keith and  Ellie \\'s apartment ,  Brass is sitting outside holding an ice pack to the back of  Vega head .  Ecklie is at the scene and informs  Warrick that  Brass got  Ellie a \" get out of jail free card \" and now  Ellie boyfriend  Keith is dead .  Warrick asks  Ecklie why  Warrick is even at the crime scene since  Warrick is day shift ;  Ecklie replies it \\'s because  Warrick \\'s dedicated .  Det .  Vega tells Nick and Warrick that  Keith was shot in the throat and the first responding officer found  Brass in the apartment woozy .  Ellie is in the wind and officers are out looking for  Ellie .  Warrick checks Brass \\'s gun and finds that there is one round missing .    Det .  Vega interviews  Brass off the record .  Brass admits going to the apartment and says dispatch was n\\'t notified , as it was a personal visit .  Brass went looking for  Ellie , not  Keith . A flashback shows  Brass entering the apartment looking for  Ellie when  Keith hit  Keith the head with a baseball bat .  Brass says everything is a blur after that . Brass does not recall drawing  Keith gun , to which  Vega replies that  Brass is leaving something out .  Vega tells  Brass that they are going to pick  Ellie up eventually .    Warrick is printing  Brass \\'s gun when Nick enters . Nick states that the gun \\'s magazine was n\\'t emptied and that police officers are trained to shoot to kill .  Warrick finds blood on the back of the gun \\'s grip and Nick remarks that novice shooters get their hands pinched in the slide , or \" slide bite . \"  Warrick concludes that  Brass did n\\'t shoot  Keith . In the interrogation room ,  Warrick asks  Brass to show  Warrick  Warrick hands .  Warrick then asks  Brass for  Warrick badge ;  Brass eventually complies .   In the Duffy \\'s basement ,  Sara and Special Agent  Beckman marvel at the Duffy \\'s counterfeiting process - high - end printers , multiple inks , heavy paper , etc .  Matt shows  Sara and  Beckman  Matt burn plates . Everything is in place except for where the money is .  Cindy replies that there is no money , which  Beckman surprisingly confirms .  Beckman replies that \" Duffy \" is a code name , and that both  Matt and  Cindy are undercover federal agents . The sting was to put bait money in the hands of criminals and see how it leads to law enforcement .  Beckman tells  Sara that  Sara passed the test and  Sara should feel very proud , but  Sara does n\\'t .   Greg tells  Warrick that  Warrick ran  Ellie \\'s DNA from Brass \\'s badge from when  Sara spit on  Warrick .  Sara has no markers in common with Brass , proving that  Ellie is not Brass \\'s biological daughter . Furthermore , the blood on  Brass \\'s gun did not come back to Brass ,  Ellie , or  Keith meaning that there is still a shooter out there with a cut on  Warrick hand .    Warrick looks over the  Baja flight manifest again and sees that  Keith \\'s credit card was used to purchase another ticket on the flight for Marty Gilmore . When  Brass and  Warrick arrive at  Marty \\'s place ,  Warrick is unsuccessfully trying to start  Warrick dirt bike for an escape .  Brass recognizes  Warrick as the hitchhiker  Warrick let get away when  Warrick originally pulled  Keith over .  Warrick congratulates  Marty for tricking  Brass and offers to shake  Warrick hand . When  Marty shakes  Marty hand ,  Warrick sees a cut .  Warrick says that  Marty shot  Keith with  Brass \\'s gun .  Brass adds that  Marty was in the other room when  Marty entered  Keith \\'s apartment . In a flashback ,  Brass is seen knocked out on the floor by Keith , who is worried  Marty killed  Marty .  Marty negatively replies and shoots  Marty with  Brass \\'s gun .  Marty caught  Marty hand in the gun \\'s slide , then put the gun back in  Brass \\'s hand .  Marty killed  Keith to take over  Keith drug operation .    Warrick asks  Marty about  Ellie ; Mary replies that  Ellie should be in jail for shooting Vincent . Suddenly ,  Marty starts to get sick and tells  Warrick  Warrick took a laxative .  Warrick realizes that  Marty is about to overdose and tells  Brass to call for a medic . Instead ,  Brass stands silently and watches  Marty . After being told again ,  Brass comes to and radios for a medic .  Marty fears that  Marty \\'s going to die , but  Brass says it \\'s worse -  Marty \\'s going to live .   In the hospital ,  Warrick returns Brass \\'s badge to  Warrick , telling  Marty  Marty only took the badge to get  Ellie \\'s DNA off of it .  Warrick tells  Brass that the DNA results showed  Ellie is not  Warrick biological daughter and that  Warrick did n\\'t know she was adopted .  Brass says that she \\'s not adopted , telling  Warrick to \" call it the mailman \\'s . \"  Ellie does n\\'t know , however , that  Brass is not  Ellie biological father .

      "s03e08 ['Synopsis Catherine called in by a pornographic - film developer to view graphic footage from a snuff movie in which a woman is brutally slain . But the clues are scant : The murderer is n\\'t clearly seen , the cheap - looking hotel room could be almost anywhere and the film was sent to the developer anonymously . Outside of town ,  Grissom investigates another killing when a body , smothered with fire ants , is found stuffed inside a large toolbox . The initial findings indicate that the person died well over a year earlier .   Plot Victim : Susan Hodap ( deceased )   On the case : Catherine Willows , Sara Sidle , Warrick Brown , Dale Sulik    Catherine and  Grissom have been called in by a snuff film processor , who claims that  Catherine processes hundreds of pornographic films , but this one is different . On screen , after a couple finishes their act , the man takes out a knife and slits the woman \\'s throat . Just from looking at the film ,  Catherine and  Grissom confirm that it \\'s real blood .  Grissom gets a call from Brass and has to leave the case .    Det . Dale Sulik informs  Catherine that they found P.O. boxes that snuff companies use , but  Catherine says it \\'s a dead end .  Archie was able to blow up a picture of the victim , and  Det . Sulik leaves to compare  Catherine to any missing persons .  Catherine is looking over the negatives , but can only find fingerprint smudges .  Catherine informs  Catherine that contacting the manufacturer of the negatives wo n\\'t help , as porno companies buy everything in cash so they ca n\\'t be traced .   In the AV lab ,  Archie and Warick are going over the snuff film again . They pause the film and find what looks to be a mole on the male \\'s back .  Warrick has  Archie focus on the window , which is not fully covered by curtains . When the image is blown up , the Stratosphere tower is shown in the background . With this information ,  Archie is able to triangulate what street the film was filmed on .   Catherine , Sara ,  Warrick , and Det . Sulik visit the hotel where the filming took place . The CSIs each take a room , with  Catherine finding the exact room the murder took place in . All of the furniture has been removed from the room .  Catherine notices the wall has recently been painted .  Warrick runs a UV light over the wall and finds the presence of arterial spray .   Catherine , Warrick , and Det . Sulik interview the hotel security guard , Johnny Vane , who says he has been working there for four months . However , he does n\\'t know anything about a murder . He also says he does n\\'t know about someone painting the room , but  Catherine notices primer on his jacket . They also find a mole on the back of his neck , proving that he was in the snuff film .  Johnny admits that  Johnny was paid to have sex with the girl , but left when  Johnny part was over .  Johnny did n\\'t call the police when  Johnny saw the blood later because  Johnny did n\\'t want to lose  Johnny job .  Catherine has  Johnny arrested .   Catherine , Sara , and Warrick go over the video again and determine that  Johnny was telling the truth ; there is another guy in the video almost two inches taller than  Johnny . A shadow in the video shows that  Johnny left the room . They determine that the person originally filming the scene is the murderer . The perpetrator shows no physical marks that would help identify him .  Catherine and Sara explain that porno films use short ends of  film , which means that the person filming does n\\'t know when  film film is going to roll out - the camera slows down ,  film film stutters , and the camera gets hit with more light . An editor will cut that part out .    Catherine and  Sara visit the snuff film producer , who guides them to the place where all of the film cuttings are . They empty a barrel looking for 16 mm film .  Sara is able to find the film and notices that there is a small table and lamp in the corner of the room .  Catherine notices the lamp as being the same one that  Catherine passed in the hotel lobby earlier .    Catherine and  Warrick go over the short ends of  film and determine that the lamp in  film film and the lamp from the lobby are identical , and that they both have a red bulb .  Warrick guesses that whoever unscrewed the original hot light bulb might have licked their fingers and left saliva behind on the red bulb . Through CODIS , they are able to find a match to a Douglas Sampson .    Catherine and Det . Sulik visit  Douglas who lives in a residential neighborhood . As  they question him ,  they hear moaning in the background , as if he is currently filming another snuff film .  Warrick is standing in the street with Johnny Vane , who positively identifies Douglas as the cameraman from  film film . In  Douglas \\'s house ,  Catherine accuses  him of killing the woman in  film film , but  Douglas says  they have no proof . If  they did ,  they would have arrested  him already .  Douglas seems to have the sniffles and wipes  Douglas nose , with  Catherine asking  him if  him has a cold . Outside ,  Warrick is examining  Douglas \\'s car and finds soil in the wheel well .  Catherine and  Warrick remark that  Douglas washed the wheel , but neglected the wheel well . The soil is a butterscotch color , and  Catherine and  Warrick remember a body dump a few years back in a mountain range that had the same color soil .    Warrick gets a call from Det . Sulik who says that they found the victim in River \\'s Edge in Navajo County . At the scene ,  Warrick finds the girl in the woods wrapped in a curtain and covered in twigs and leaves . In autopsy , Doc Robbins identifies the woman as Susan Hodap whose cause of death was exsanguination from transection of the carotid artery . He tells Catherine and Sara that  Susan was HIV positive . Through an internet search ,  Catherine and  Sara find that  Susan tested positive for  HIV twice and was quarantined .  Sara surmises that  Susan was in the snuff film because  Sara got bounced from porn for testing positive twice .    Warrick is upset because  Warrick is getting no prints from the curtain  Susan was wrapped in , nor does  Warrick have a second donor to the blood . There is nothing to link  Douglas to the murder .  Sara tells  Warrick that the film shows that  Susan was bleeding all over the murderer when  Susan throat was slashed .  Susan and  Catherine believe that the blood was transferred to the perpetrator . Since  Susan had  HIV ,  Susan killer might , too .   They are able to get a blood sample from  Douglas . Under interrogation ,  Warrick says  Warrick never had sex with  Susan ; in fact ,  Warrick never even met  Susan .  Catherine and Sara enter the room and  Catherine asks  Douglas if  Douglas still feels sick .  Douglas replies that  Douglas does , and  Catherine tells  Douglas it \\'s a symptom of  HIV . The lab confirmed that  Douglas has  HIV . Furthermore , the DNA of  Susan \\'s HIV strain is the same as the strain that  Douglas has , meaning  Douglas got it directly from  Douglas . When  Douglas slit  Susan \\'s throat ,  Douglas blood got in  Douglas eyes and the HIV transferred and entered  Douglas bloodstream .   Victim : Randy Trachsel ( deceased )   On the case : Gil Grissom , Nick Stokes , Jim Brass   Brass calls  Grissom while  Grissom is at the other crime scene . A body has been found inside of a toolbox , but fire ants have emerged from it biting everyone nearby . As  Grissom is the bug expert ,  Grissom knowledge is needed on the case .   Brass tells  Grissom that a driver was passing by , spotted the toolbox , and thought  Grissom could put it to good use .  Grissom opened the toolbox , freaked out , and called the police .  Grissom opens the toolbox to find hundreds of fire ants covering a skeleton ; the ants are using the skeleton as a colony site .  Grissom says  Grissom \\'s going to have to take everything to evidence .   In autopsy , Doc Robbins and  Grissom take the proper precautions to shield themselves from the ants . Doc Robbins estimates that the victim has been dead for at least a year ;  Grissom says it smells more like two . The victim sustained fractures to both clavicles , and there are two puncture wounds on the back side about 18 inches apart .  Grissom finds a pupa case among the ants and claims that , with the case ,  Grissom can establish an etymological timeline .   With a little help from Greg ,  Grissom is able to estimate that the victim died about nineteen months ago .  Grissom gets a visit from Teri Miller , whom  Grissom asks for help on identifying the body .  Grissom finds a previously undiscovered dung beetle in the skull \\'s nasal cavity , indicating the victim was possibly killed around large animals , like in a farm or zoo .    Nick examines the empty toolbox and finds a void on the inside lip . At the bottom of the toolbox ,  Grissom finds a triangular piece of metal . The metal comes back as carbon steel with a trace of rust on it .  Grissom says that that type of material was used in old scalpels , but also notes that it looks like it \\'s in some sort of repeating pattern .  Nick traces the piece of metal on paper and believes that it could have come from a saw , but  Grissom says the piece is n\\'t sharp enough .  Nick then comes to the conclusion that the metal came from a cheap spur , like cowboys wear .    Teri is able to reconstruct the victim \\'s head from the skull and  Teri and  Grissom realize the victim has Down Syndrome . Brass contacts different places associated with people with Down Syndrome and is able to find a match . The victim is Randy Trachsel and his last known employment was at the Las Vegas Ranch .  Grissom connects the ranch to horses and dung beetles .   Grissom ,  Nick , and Brass head to the ranch and speak to the ranch \\'s manager , Pete Banson .  Pete recognizes Randy \\'s photo and says  Grissom hired  Grissom about two years ago then , all of a sudden ,  Grissom disappeared .  Pete says  Pete never let  Randy ride the horses ;  Randy was only hired to muck the stalls .  They interview Enrique Vasquez , who is the new person mucking the stalls .  Grissom recalls that the other cowboys used to call  Randy \" Stubbs . \"  Nick notices spurs on  Enrique \\'s boots and tells  Nick  They need to take the spurs back to the lab .   In the lab ,  Grissom finds that one of the spurs is missing a triangular piece - the same one found in the toolbox .  Nick interviews  Pete , and tells  Grissom that  Enrique got the spurs from \" Heroes Row . \"  Pete says that is where the cowboys toss their unwanted gear .  Nick tells  Nick that the type of spur found was banned in the 1970 \\'s and that it \\'s previous owner is someone who is \" stuck in the 70 \\'s . \"  Pete mentions Billy Rattison , a pro bronco rider .    Grissom and  Nick go back to the ranch to speak to  Billy and notice a new toolbox in  Billy truck bed .  Billy is a surly guy who throws the word \" retard \" around , to which  Grissom corrects  Billy .  Billy tells  Billy that  Randy had Down Syndrome , but  Billy  Billy cares about is that  Randy was \" sticking  Randy nose in where it did n\\'t belong . \" A flashback shows  Billy treating  Randy poorly when  Randy was trying to help  Randy .  Grissom asks  Billy if  Grissom toolbox is new , but  Billy says it \\'s a few months old and that  someone stole  someone old one .  Grissom shows  Billy a photo of  Grissom at a rodeo , which  Billy dates to March 2000 ;  Nick notes that that was nineteen months ago .  Grissom and  Nick say that  Billy was out of town at the time of  Billy \\'s death and that they need a more definitive timeline .    Grissom has Archie run a test on the rust found on the spur . Due to the weather and level of rust , they are able to pinpoint the start of the oxidation to May 2000 .  Grissom notes that  Billy was in town during that time . In  Grissom office ,  Grissom is trying to figure out what caused the puncture wounds on  Randy \\'s back when  Grissom has a revelation .    Grissom and  Nick go back to the ranch again and tell  Pete that they believe the puncture wounds  Randy sustained was caused by one of the bulls and their horns . However , while  Randy \\'s wounds were 18 inches apart , the bulls horns are 24 inches apart .  Pete notes that they cut the horns of the bulls to prevent injuries like that and this is the only bull he has . Grissom ,  Nick , and Brass are waiting for  Billy by  Billy car and  Grissom notices that there used to be something on the hood .  Billy says it was belt buckles and that they , too , were stolen . With permission ,  Grissom goes through  Billy \\'s toolbox and finds a hood ornament of bull \\'s horns .  Nick measures the horns and they are 18 inches apart . The horns test positive for blood .   A flashback shows  Billy falling off of  Billy bronco and  Randy smiling at  Billy . Irate ,  Billy ties  Randy up and puts  Billy on the bronco .  Randy falls off of the horse and sustains one of  Randy shoulder injuries . Afterwards ,  Randy follows  Randy out and  Billy accidentally shoves  Randy into the hood ornament .  Randy stuffs  Randy \\'s body in the toolbox and loses  Randy spur in the process . As  Randy leaves ,  Grissom tells  Billy that the definition for the word \" retard \" is \" to hinder or hold someone back . \"  Grissom informs  Billy that  Grissom life is about to become \" retarded . \"']\n",
      "s03e12 ['Synopsis When a raven is spotted with a human eyeball in its beak , it \\'s up to Catherine , Nick and Sara to find the rest of the body and the killer . Meanwhile , a normal autopsy turns into a special one when the victim is n\\'t dead . Doc Robbins and David manage to save his life , only to have him die later .  Grissom and Warrick then try to find out who wanted the man dead .   Plot Victim : Amy Ennis / Kelly Easton ( deceased )   On the case : Catherine Willows , Nick Stokes , Sara Sidle , Jim Brass   A group of birdwatchers are looking to cross some sightings off of their list in Floyd Lamb State Park when they see a raven carrying a human eyeball . At the scene ,  Grissom notes to  Catherine that ravens have been known to travel up to 30 miles from roost to feeding ground , giving them a 2,800 mile search area .   In the lab ,  Grissom examines the eyeball and removes a contact lens as well as some vitreous fluid . In another part of the lab ,  Catherine removes different things from the raven \\'s nest , including a baby \\'s toy .  Grissom enters and tells  Catherine about the iris \\'s color ;  Catherine quickly concludes that the body has been dead for less than 48 hours . They note that there are seagull feathers in the nest and seagulls can be found near lake mead . However , ground limestone is also found , and that is not found near there .  Catherine guesses that the raven got the eyeball from Pendale Landfill , where limestone is used as ground cover .   Catherine , Nick , and  Sara visit the landfill . With help , they are able to zero in on where they believe they should be looking for evidence .  Catherine uncovers a female leg , while  Sara find the torso and head , which is missing an eye . They note that the temperature under the body parts is 120 degrees and based on the time of the death , the body should be bloated . However , it is not . The body looks torn up , but they realize that it could be from the bulldozers .   In the morgue , Doc Robbins tells  Catherine that the cause of death is indeterminate , but blunt force trauma could be a possibility . There is some perimortem bruising around the left eye and the limb removal is relatively clean , meaning that was done postmortem . There is a scar on the body indicating that the victim gave birth . An x - ray shows that the body has something implanted in it .   In another room ,  Nick and  Sara are going over the trash that was buried near the body . Among the items are a frying pan , a home pregnancy test ( result : negative ) , and a bag of frozen peas .  Nick goes through mail in the trash , while  Sara marks down the addresses on a map as they try to narrow down where the victim came from . They narrow the location down to a street - Storm Cloud Lane .   Doc Robbins tells  Catherine that the item he was able to pull from the body was an artificial spinal disc . The doc states that less than 1,000 surgeries have been performed in the United States using that kind of disc . With the components of the disc and its angle , Doc Robbins informs  Catherine he narrowed the list down to one person - Amy Ennis from Austin , Texas .   Catherine ,  Nick , and  Sara visit Storm Cloud Lane and line up all of the trash bins in the street . They are able to find the presence of blood in six bins , with three of those testing positive for human blood .  Sara notes that blood pools to the bottom and that , since there was blood on the outside of the bin from it being dumped at the landfill , it \\'s likely the body was in this particular bin . They match the bin with the house it belongs to .  Catherine speaks to Daniel Easton , who has no idea how blood got in  his trash bin .  his has also never heard of Amy Ennis . Daniel \\'s two kids ,  Charlie and Nora , come home and  Charlie tells  Catherine  Charlie has been divorced for five years .    Brass tells  Catherine that  Brass have n\\'t found  Amy \\'s next of kin yet .  Catherine points out that  Amy had a kid , but  Brass corrects  Catherine and says  Catherine gave birth . That does n\\'t mean  Catherine had a kid .  Brass did , however , find  Amy \\'s car in the parking lot of the Tangiers . The car is brought in for processing .  Catherine goes through  Amy \\'s suitcase and finds some risque lingerie to go along with regular clothes and toiletries .  Catherine has  Greg run  DNA on the toothbrush , and  DNA DNA matches Amy Ennis .  Nick fumigates the steering wheel and finds a print . However ,  Nick finds that there is no Amy Ennis in the system and that the print matches  Kelly named Kelly Easton .  Catherine remembers that  Easton was the last name of the guy  Catherine interviewed earlier .    Catherine questions  Easton Easton again and  Easton changes  Easton story .  Easton claims  Kelly went to get  Kelly hair done and never came home .  Catherine suggests that maybe  Kelly left because of some type of abuse . However ,  Daniel says the CSIs were at  Daniel house five years prior , did a grid search , and came up empty .  Daniel would love to be given a reason as to why  Daniel wife left .  Daniel says  Daniel got left with neighbors who think  Daniel killed  Daniel wife , in - laws that sued  Daniel for custody , and a loss of job and friends .  Catherine remarks that  Daniel did n\\'t kill  Daniel wife .... at least five years ago  Daniel did n\\'t .    Catherine and  Sara search  Daniel \\'s house , and  Sara finds blood on a chair and some panties in the bedroom .  Daniel admits to  Sara that  Kelly came back a month ago and that they \" reconnected . \" Back in the bedroom ,  Catherine tape lifts some hairs  Catherine finds on the bed and the bed \\'s pillow . Meanwhile ,  Nick finds disturbing drawings in a notepad in  Charlie \\'s room .    Nick talks to  Charlie who says  Nick \\'s not surprised ;  Nick mother left without telling the family and died the same way . Meanwhile ,  Catherine speaks to Nora , who says  Catherine last saw  Catherine mother when  Catherine was in seventh grade . However ,  Catherine never thought  Catherine mother was dead .  Catherine asks to sit down as she starts rubbing her stomach . When  Catherine asks  Catherine if  Daniel is seeing anyone ,  Catherine curiously replies \" How could  Daniel ? \"   Back inside the house ,  Catherine looks through  Catherine \\'s room and finds a bottle of high potency supplements and a hidden silver bracelet . In the kitchen ,  Catherine finds blood on the tile and a circular void on the wall where a frying pan should go . In the garage ,  Nick tells  Catherine  Nick found hairs in the freezer between packages of frozen peas .  Catherine notes that  Kelly \\'s body showed no swelling and that  Catherine fractures were clean .  Catherine surmises that  Kelly \\'s body was frozen before it was brought to the landfill . A reenactment shows  Kelly getting hit with a frying pan , hitting  Kelly head on the corner of the kitchen counter , and getting stuffed into the garage freezer .   In the interrogation room .  Daniel says  Daniel did n\\'t know  Kelly was dead .  Daniel figured  Kelly just left  Daniel again .  Brass relays the information that  Kelly had been gone for four years , eleven months , and one week . After missing for three more weeks ( five years total ) ,  Kelly \\'s estate would be allowed to be distributed to  Daniel .  Brass notes that  Daniel had a $ 500,000 life insurance policy on  Daniel wife , but  Daniel says that they had a policy on each other .  Brass also finds that  Daniel has been spending a lot of money on expensive things recently as if  Daniel were expecting a windfall .  Daniel lays out the theory that  Kelly came back before  Daniel could collect and so  Daniel took action . However ,  Daniel continues to state that  Daniel did n\\'t kill  Daniel wife .   In the lab ,  Greg informs  Catherine that the blood from the bedroom chair and the blood from the kitchen both came back to  Kelly . The hairs from the freezer and from the bedroom pillow also came back to  Kelly . The hairs from the bed , however , are pubic hairs and they belong to  Catherine .  Catherine guesses that  Daniel did have a new girlfriend -  Daniel daughter .    Catherine talks to Nora , who says that the silver bracelet found was a gift from  Catherine father .  Catherine remarks that  Catherine deserved the bracelet for taking care of everything after  Catherine mother disappeared .  Catherine clams up when  Catherine asks  Catherine if that \\'s all  Catherine took care of . When confronted with the evidence that  Catherine was in  Catherine father \\'s bed ,  Catherine says that  Catherine father loves  Catherine .  Catherine looks down and sees that  Catherine is lactating through  Catherine shirt ;  Catherine shockingly says that  Catherine is pregnant .    Catherine rushes to the interrogation room and starts berating  Daniel .  Daniel is shocked when told that  Catherine is pregnant .  Catherine guesses that  Kelly came back home and saw  Daniel in bed with  Catherine , so  Kelly killed  Kelly and bought  Catherine off with a bracelet .  Daniel says  Daniel bought the bracelet for  Daniel wife , but  Catherine is insistent they are going to nail  Daniel for murder .    Catherine visits the doctor who runs a checkup on  Catherine . As the doctor leaves the room ,  Catherine whispers something to  Catherine .  Catherine informs  Sara that  Catherine is actually a virgin .  Catherine actually has Pseudocyesis , or \" imagined pregnancy . \" When the desire to become pregnant is so strong , the hormone levels can change , setting off all of the biological signs of pregnancy . Signs include a swollen abdomen and milk production in both breasts , which can be set off by stress .    Nick enters and tells them that the two stains found on the inside of the shirt from the dump tested positive for  Catherine . However , the blood on the shirt came back to  Kelly .  Catherine confirms that the bracelet also belonged to  Kelly ; the epithelials confirmed it .  Sara concludes that  Catherine is in love with  Sara father .   In the interrogation room ,  Catherine admits that the shirt belongs to  Catherine . However ,  Catherine does n\\'t know how the blood got on it .  Catherine tells  Catherine that the bracelet was a gift from  Catherine father to  Catherine mother , but  Catherine denies it and says the bracelet was for  Catherine . In a flashback ,  Catherine is seen opening the door to the bedroom while  Daniel is romancing  Kelly .  Catherine starts to freak out and pops some pills . When  Kelly tries to surprise  Catherine in the kitchen ,  Catherine whirls around and smacks  Catherine with a frying pan .  Catherine steals the bracelet off of  Kelly and drags the body to the freezer in the garage .    Catherine tearfully says that it was n\\'t fair .  Catherine yells that  Catherine never asked for  Catherine anything , and  Catherine tells  Catherine the one thing  Catherine wanted  Catherine could n\\'t have .  Catherine is arrested . While being hauled out of the room ,  Catherine hysterically yells out that  Catherine \\'s going to have a baby . Brass guesses that  Catherine \\'s attorney is going to tell  Catherine to plead insanity .    Victim : Fred Stearns ( initially alive )   On the case : Gil Grissom , Warrick Brown   Doc Robbins tells  Grissom that the electrolyte and glucose levels in the other victim \\'s eye were normal , showing that  Victim victim was n\\'t dehydrated or diabetic . As  Grissom leaves the autopsy room , David Phillips tells him about  Victim victim lying on his table - a 35-year old car salesman named Fred Stearns who dropped dead of a heart attack . David notes that it \\'s just \" a routine autopsy . \" On his recorder , Doc Robbins states the body was warm to the touch and that rigamortis was not present . They find a black substance on  Fred \\'s mouth , gums , and lips . As David starts to slice open the body , it begins to bleed indicating it \\'s still alive . David and Doc Robbins rush to revive  Victim victim .    Grissom and  Warrick visit the car dealership that  Fred works at .  Warrick informs  Grissom that  Fred has respiratory paralysis . The preliminary report on the blood work shows an organic poison in  Fred \\'s system , which would explain the discoloration around  Grissom mouth . They observe car salesman Marty Gibson hard at work trying to sell a car and forge a relationship with a customer .    Grissom and  Warrick go inside the dealership and speak to receptionist Nancy Linden , who has secretly brought  her dog to work with  her . They show  her a warrant to search the premises regarding  Fred \\'s attempted murder .  Nancy replies that  Fred had a heart attack and died .  Grissom corrects  Nancy , saying  Fred did not have a heart attack and is very much alive .  Nancy brings  Grissom and Warrick to  Fred \\'s desk where nothing of  Fred has been touched .  Warrick notes that the poison could have come from anything on the desk .  Grissom finds an odd substance on  Fred \\'s phone , while  Warrick finds something on  Fred \\'s jacket . They open fellow salesman Clyde Hinton \\'s drawers and find super glue ( the substance on  Fred \\'s phone ) and chewing gum , which turns one \\'s mouth black .  Clyde is a prankster , and  Clyde uses  Clyde jokes to gain a sales advantage .  Warrick gets a call and tells  Grissom that  Fred passed away .... again .   In autopsy , David slices  Fred open again and , to his relief , does n\\'t draw blood this time . He observes that the poison may have gotten into  Fred  Fred \\'s system and that a stomach ulcer may have helped that happen . The ulcer opened a channel directly from the digestive tract to the blood stream .  Grissom tells Doc Robbins that the toxicology report says the \" ink gum \" did not kill  Fred .    Warrick looks under a microscope and finds that the material found on  Fred \\'s jacket was snakeskin .  Grissom confirms this by adding that the toxicology report result shows that  Fred was poisoned with snake venom .  They visit Marty Gibson back at the car dealership and tell him snakeskin was found on his jacket .  Warrick goes over the company \\'s expense reports and finds that Marty charged the company for two dozen mice . When  They ask Marty what he did with the mice , he shows them the venomous snakes he has for pets , as well as the mice he feeds it .   An animal expert in the lab informs  Grissom that the snakeskin came from a diamondback rattlesnake .  Grissom notes that  Fred showed no puncture wounds , but  Fred says Marty could have milked the snake since  Grissom clearly knows how to handle them .  Grissom figures that the snake could have been milked and the venom brought to the office and put in  Fred \\'s coffee .  Fred says  Fred knows macho people who drink bits of snake venom and they are fine . However , since  Fred had a stomach ulcer , the venom could have done  Grissom in . The expert says that since  Fred showed no signs of tissue death , the venom did not come from the rattlesnake . Marty has two other snakes that could have been used for the venom , as their venom is neurotoxic and the test on  Fred came back positive for alpha neurotoxins . Those toxins cause total paralysis , which explains why  Fred ended up in the morgue the first time .    Greg tells  Grissom and  Warrick that the proteins in snake venom vary from species to species and even from snake to snake . The venom found in  Fred did n\\'t match any of the snakes that Marty owns .  Warrick questions whether it was a coincidence that Marty owns venomous snakes and venom was found in  Fred \\'s system .  Grissom says that a coincidence is a scientific anomaly ; perhaps Marty got rid of the snake .   In Nancy Linden \\'s house , a snake wrangler tells  Grissom that  Nancy called the police hysterical that a snake ate  Nancy dog . The snake is a monocled cobra , indigenous to southeast Asia . The wrangler asked  Nancy where she got the snake from and she replied that a coworker asked her to \" snakesit . \"  Grissom guesses that it was Marty Gibson .  Nancy , sitting crying on the couch , tells  Grissom that Marty said  Grissom had a surefire way to win a trip to Cabo and that  Grissom would take her with  Grissom if she promised to watch the snake for a few days . She admits to  Grissom that Marty used to be the \" goodwill guy \" -  Grissom had no client list of  Grissom own so  Grissom had to live off of hand - me - downs from other salesman and perform tasks for them like getting them coffee . Now that  Fred is dead , Marty got to move up the ladder .    Grissom guesses that Marty , tired of getting coffee for  Fred and getting bossed around , slipped the snake venom into  Fred \\'s coffee . As Marty is arrested ,  Grissom tells him that snake venom plus coffee lead them directly to him . Marty admits that  Grissom worked hard to get a desk on the second floor , only to get bossed around by  Fred .  Grissom rants that  Fred never threw  Grissom any clients and that opportunity knocked .']\n",

Grissom leaves the room , and then there 's a knock on the door ;  Brass answers  it ; it 's  Grissom who notes that the door locks automatically when  it closes . Her keys are missing from her purse ;  Grissom wonders why she did n't come back in if she had her keys with her ?  Brass says that maybe she vanished ;  Grissom says that it 's a molecular impossibility .   At the front entrance to the dorms ,  Warrick comments on all the cameras and security ;  Sara arrives and ca n't get in because  Sara does n't live in the dorm .  Grissom tells Nick to check the cameras ;  Grissom and  Sara check the room , while Catherine and  Warrick check the halls .  Sara notes that Paige had asked for all of  Sara mail to be forwarded , including  Sara security deposit .  Grissom examines the walls , and finds a substance , which  Grissom tastes , and comments that it 's minty .  Sara says that it 's the poor man 's Spackle , toothpaste ; it 's a cheap way to leave the room the way that you got it so that you 'd get your security deposit back .  Sara notes that there are two beds , and asks about a roommate ;  Grissom says that there was a roommate , Jennifer Riggs , who left two weeks into the semester , and Brass is checking on  Sara .  Grissom notes that there 's something missing ;  Sara suggests that it might have been an area rug , which could have been used to hide a body and carry it out of the dorm .   A newscast on TV reports on  Paige 's disappearance ; officers use scent dogs in the hallway .  Catherine and  Warrick check the garbage chute in the hall ;  Catherine is rigged up to go down the chute ;  Catherine opens the door and it snaps shut ;  Catherine comments that it 's quick .  Warrick holds it open while  Catherine lowers  Catherine into the chute . In the security office ,  Nick goes over the tapes with the security officer ;  Nick sees the real - time tape of  Catherine going down the chute , then has the officer go back to when  Paige disappeared .  They find a spot on the tape where the camera is covered ;  Nick asks how the guard missed this , and the guard says that  They ca n't watch every minute .  They examine the footage , and  Nick notes that the camera gets more than it shows ;  They extend the picture and see that the person who covered the camera put his hand on the wall for leverage .   In the chute ,  Catherine looks at sides of walls and finds between something on the sides between the first and second floors ;  Catherine thinks  it might be blood .  Catherine sniffs  it and realizes that  it 's pizza .  Catherine continues down and ends up in the dumpster , and tells Warrick via radio that the chute is clear .  Catherine notes that the dumpster also seems to be clear , and the trash is picked up every morning . The scent dogs are circling around by the dumpster ; they 've lost the scent .   In the room ,  Catherine checks the walls and beds for stains , finds evidence of semen on the mattress and circles it for testing . Nick checks the hallway and dusts for prints where the person leaned to cover the camera ; he gets a palm print .  Catherine comes out and tells him that  Catherine got DNA , blood and semen in the room .    Grissom talks to Mr. and Mrs. Rycoff , who want to know what 's going on and what  they 're doing to find  they daughter .  Grissom does n't tell  they much ,  Grissom just asks  they to let  Grissom do  Grissom job .  Grissom tells  they that the only connection that  they have to  they daughter right now is through the evidence that  Grissom and  Grissom team are collecting and interpreting , so  Grissom needs to think .  Catherine comes to see  Grissom in the security room where  Grissom 's viewing the tapes , looking at the part where the lens was covered ;  Grissom asks  Catherine what it is , and  Catherine suggests that it looks like someone carrying something ; maybe a rug .  Nick comes in and tells  Grissom that  Nick got a name to go with the palm print .    They interview Henry McFadden , a frat boy ;  Nick admits that  Nick covered the camera , and tells  They that  Nick did it , but  Nick was n't alone .  They realize that  They 're not talking about the same thing ;  Henry says  Henry 's talking about ' boosting ' some of the furniture from the 4th floor as a prank , and says that  Henry and  Henry friends took some lamps , a coffee table , toilet paper ;  Nick asks why they took the stuff from the 4th floor , and  Henry says that the 4th and 7th have the best stuff , and the 4th is closer to the door , so it 's faster to get out .  Grissom asks if  Henry knows  Paige ;  Henry admits that  Henry does , that they live in the same dorm and have Economy class together , but then says that  Henry had nothing to do with what happened to  Paige .  Grissom asks if  they went out , and  Henry admits that  they did ;  Henry tells  they that it was only once or twice and then  they did n't go out again because  Paige was seeing some other guy , someone older and more mature than  Henry , but  Paige never told  Henry who it was .  Grissom tells  Henry that  Grissom can go ; Brass tells  Henry to return the things that  Henry took . After  Henry goes ,  Grissom comments that they 've hit a dead end which is the worst place to be on a missing persons case .   A TV newscast shows an interview with Mr. and Mrs. Rycoff , who say that  Paige wanted to come home , and that  Paige was going to make a new start on life ;  Grissom watches . In the lab ,  Greg tests  Paige 's personal items for DNA and gets a sample of  Paige from  Paige toothbrush , and tells them that the blood and semen are n't  Paige , but that there was Rohypnol in the blood .  Sara comments that it 's possible that they 're looking for two victims : one who was raped and one who is missing .   Nick and Catherine watch the security tapes of the frat boys stealing the furniture , then move on to the outside tapes of the taxi waiting for  Paige .   Brass takes  Grissom and  Sara to the Riggs ' home , telling them that  Jennifer was sexually assaulted . Inside ,  Jennifer asks them how they knew , since  Jennifer never told anyone about it , not even Paige .  Sara tells  Sara that they found semen on the bed , and evidence of Rohypnol in the blood that they assume is  Sara ;  Sara then says that it might be the same person , as they both shared the same room . They want to know what  Jennifer remembers about the rape , but  Jennifer ca n't remember anything at all ;  Grissom tells  Jennifer that this is a side - effect of the drug , and the attacker might have been counting on this .  Jennifer tells them what little  Jennifer knows : it was a floor party , and that 's why  Jennifer left , because someone that  Jennifer lived with did  this to  Jennifer , and  Jennifer would never know who  this was .   At the dorm ,  Catherine ,  Grissom and  Warrick take the elevator up , and  Catherine asks  Grissom why a rapist would volunteer  Grissom DNA ?  Grissom points out that they 're looking for evidence in  Paige 's disappearance , and  Warrick explains that they 're pulling a ' bait and switch ' where they get the DNA for use in one case , but once they have  it , they can use  it for any other purpose . They take samples from all the boys , and take them back to the lab ;  Greg tests them and gets a match to the semen .   At the baseball diamond , Brass and  Grissom talk to Kevin Watson , and tell him that they know he assaulted Jennifer Riggs . He claims that he does n't know anything about that or about  Paige ;  Grissom tells him that they got the semen from the bed and matched it to his sample that he gave . He tells them that he was out of town on away games when  Paige disappeared ; they arrest  Paige for the rape of Jennifer Riggs , and  Warrick confirms that the team was away when  Paige went missing .    Catherine and  Nick continue to watch the security tapes ;  Catherine notices that the same car has circled around six times , and comments that circling twice might have meant that the person was looking for a parking spot , but six times is suspicious . They zoom in on the picture and note a parking permit in the front of the car , and that it 's a silver Volvo . At the campus , they find the car ; it belongs to Professor Robert Woodbury . They check the trunk of the car and find a blanket covering something ; they pull it off and find golf clubs .  Grissom tells  Nick to take the car to the lab and process it .   In Professor Woodbury 's office ,  they ask  Grissom about  Paige ;  Grissom admits that  Paige was in  Grissom introductory course in philosophy .  Grissom finds some broken pottery on the floor and comments that it could be signs of a struggle . Prof . Woodbury is n't telling  they much , so  Grissom tells him that  Paige has been missing for six days now and  they want to know where  Paige is ;  they know that he was outside  Paige dorm on the night that  Paige disappeared , and his silence is only confirming his guilt for  Grissom .  Catherine tells him that  they 'll find out whatever it is that he 's hiding ;  they 'll get a warrant and search his house . Prof . Woodbury tells  they that he 's married , which  they already know ; he admits that he had an amorous relationship with  Paige , but tells  they that  Paige was never in his car or his house , only in the office . He also tells  they that he knew  Paige was leaving and went to the dorm to talk to  Paige before  Paige went , to try to convince  Paige to stay , or to say good - bye , but  Paige never came down .  Brass suggests that  Brass continue the conversation at the station ; Prof . Woodbury asks if he can meet  Brass there , as he wants to go home and talk to his wife first . Brass allows him to do this , but sends an officer with him , just in case .   At the lab ,  Nick examines Professor Woodbury 's car and finds hair caught between the seat and the headrest ; there are skin tags on  them , which  he has tested , and  them 're  Paige 's .    them interview Professor Woodbury at the station ;  he tells  them that the only thing that  he had to hide was  he affair from  he wife , and now that she knows ,  he 's willing to talk .  them tell  he that  them found  Paige 's hair in the car , and  he repeats that  Paige was never in  he car ;  he suggests that maybe it was transfer from  he sweater , but  them tell  he that the hair was ripped from  Paige 's head .  them also show  he phone records that show a call was made from  he home to  Paige 's room ;  he tells  them that  he only ever used  he cell phone to call  Paige , and on the day that the call from  he home was made ,  he was at a faculty lunch and has witnesses who will corroborate this .  Grissom asks about Mrs. Woodbury , and whether she works or not .  them question Mrs. Woodbury , asking about the call made from the house , and whether she has keys to the Volvo ; she says that  them share the car , so yes , she has keys . She then tells  them that she knew that her husband was having an affair , she 's known about all his affairs . She says that she called Paige , and then took her for a ride to ' explain the facts of life , ' to her ; that Professor Woodbury was married with children , a house and a mortgage , and would n't be leaving any of those things . She admits that she wanted to attack Paige , and that she pulled her hair , but then apologized for it , and that was it .  Grissom 's cell phone rings ; it 's  Warrick , and they 've found the body at a garbage site where the compacted dumpster contents are dumped .  Grissom meets  Grissom there and they find the compacted bundle with  Paige 's face in it .   Doc Robbins tells them that the compactor did n't kill  Paige ;  Paige was dead before that happened . He notes that  Paige has a ruptured spleen from a blunt force trauma that came via  Paige rib cage . He does n't know what kind of weapon was used , and might never find out , since  Paige body is so twisted that it 's hard to tell .   They go back to  dumpster and check  dumpster out again ;  Warrick finds some blood inside , not much , but enough for testing .  Nick notes a scrape on the side of  dumpster dumpster , and some vehicle paint chips on the ground by  dumpster dumpster .  Nick speculates that it might have been a hit and run accident and from the level of the scrape the car would have been something large like an SUV ,  Warrick figures that the driver hit  Paige and then threw  Paige body in  dumpster dumpster .  Catherine comments that the Woodburys have a silver car , not black like the vehicle paint that they 've found at  dumpster dumpster . At the lab ,  Grissom finds that the car paint is from a car that was white , then red , then black ;  Nick finds that it 's from a Cherokee , which narrows  their scope .  Warrick comes in and tells  their that the blood in  dumpster dumpster is  Paige 's ;  Nick tells  their that Brass has found the driver of the car , and is waiting for  Grissom in the interview room . Mark Doyle tells  their that his wife is expecting , and on the night that  Paige disappeared , he got a call from  Paige and thought that  Paige was in labor , so he was rushing home , and took a short - cut through the university campus . He admits that he hit  dumpster dumpster when he swerved to miss a parked car , and that  dumpster was dark and wet , but insists that he only hit the dumpster and not a person . He tells  them that if he 'd hit a person , he would have stopped .  them check his car and find that the scraping on his fender shows a clean hit against  dumpster dumpster , which means that he did n't hit  Paige .  Grissom comments that this is another dead end ;  Grissom then says that since  them solution is not ' neat , plausible and not wrong ' then perhaps what  them need is something that is messy , not plausible and right . What  them 're looking for are random events , like the chaos theory , that when applied to this situation all end in  Paige 's death ; that somewhere between  Paige 's room and  dumpster dumpster holds  them answer .   At the dorm ,  them re - create the evening ;  Sara looks out window and sees traffic , the cab waiting , and so turns to get  Sara suitcases .  Grissom points out that  Paige did n't take the suitcases with  Paige , so something else happened .  Sara , acting the way  Sara imagines  Paige did , comments that  Sara 's been cleaning all day , and wants  Sara security deposit back .  Grissom asks  Sara what 's missing ;  Sara goes over the contents of the room and realizes that the trash can is missing .  Grissom comments that the last thing that you do after cleaning is throw out the trash . They borrow a trash can from the room next door , and take it to the garbage chute ;  Sara notes that it snaps back the same way that  Catherine did .  Grissom stops a boy walking down the hall and tells  Grissom to count to 100 , then drop the garbage can down the chute .  Grissom and  Sara go downstairs ; just as they arrive at  dumpster dumpster , the garbage can comes down and goes into  dumpster dumpster .  Grissom tells Nick , Catherine and Warrick that the garbage can was missing from  Paige 's room ;  Nick wonders how  Paige ended up in  dumpster dumpster and  Catherine says that  Paige had to improvise , because there 's no way to get it from the front , so  Catherine shows them by going behind  dumpster dumpster and climbing part - way in to reach the garbage can .  Grissom comments that while  Paige was reaching for the garbage can , Mark Doyle came along and hit  dumpster dumpster , knocking  dumpster into the wall , not even knowing that  Paige was there .  Paige was crushed between the dumpster and the wall , and died , falling into  dumpster dumpster as  Paige did so .   At the station ,  Grissom tells Mr. and Mrs. Rycoff what happened , according to the evidence . They ca n't believe it , and wo n't accept that no one is to blame for their daughter 's death . Mrs. Rycoff insists that someone must be responsible .  Grissom tells  them that no one is guilty of any crime .  them say that  them 're not going to accept that , and  them 'll hire a private investigator to find out who is to blame .  them leave ;  Catherine tells  Grissom that the Rycoffs wanted closure ;  Grissom says that the truth brings closure , but  Catherine points out that that 's not always the case .\"]\n",
      "s01e23 ['Synopsis The team is investigating the ongoing murders by a signature killer who apparently has a pretty extensive knowledge of forensics and is able to not leave any evidence at the crime scenes .  Grissom becomes angry when the sheriff invites the FBI to help out with the case . Sara Sidle offers to bait the killer , which upsets Gil even more .   Plot Victim : Eileen Snow ( deceased )   On the case : entire team   On a stormy night , a woman awakens to creaking sounds before she is attacked by a hooded figure . The next day , Captain Jim Brass and CSI Gil Grissom arrive at the murder scene of Eileen Snow .  Grissom connects the murder to two others , those of Audrey Hayes and Tracy Berg , based on the killer \\'s signature . CSI Sara Sidle arrives at the scene and is clearly upset to find another victim .   While processing the scene , CSI Warrick Brown finds a hair on the bed . Sheriff Brian Mobley arrives and introduces  Grissom to FBI special agent Rick Culpepper , who is now overseeing the case .  Grissom asserts that  Grissom wants to work in conjunction with the FBI as opposed to handing over the case . Culpepper dubs the serial murderer the \" strip strangler \" . They are approached by a local security guard , Syd Goggle , who reports seeing a vehicle speeding away the previous evening .   In autopsy , Dr. Al Robbins tells  Grissom and CSI Nick Stokes that the victim suffered a blow to the head , a dose of sodium amytol , percussive control , and an object rape with a polymer object . White cotton fibers were found in Snow \\'s mouth and  throat , indicating  throat was likely silenced with a towel .   At the lab , the seminal DNA from the Snow case matches the Hayes and Berg cases . The ejaculate sample contains an unknown red substance which DNA technician Greg Sanders later identifies as ketchup .  throat compares the hair found on the bed to a hair from a previous murder and finds neither have skin tags , indicating they were planted . At the crime scene ,  Nick finds a piece of latex and concludes the killer wears latex gloves during the crimes .  Nick investigates a sound in the closet and finds a reporter hiding there .    Grissom attends a meeting called by Culpepper and learns the FBI is planning a decoy operation utilizing Sara , who matches the victim prototype . Later in  Grissom \\'s office ,  Catherine tells  Grissom that Sheriff Mobley wants her to take over the case and potentially the night shift and recommends  Grissom improve  Grissom politics .   Before the sting operation ,  throat is preparing to enter a grocery store frequented by the victims .  Grissom attempts to convince  throat that they should keep studying the killer , but  throat is impatient and wants to take action before another woman is murdered . After three hours at the grocery store , a man approaches  throat for a cigarette and tries to steal  throat wallet . It \\'s immediately realized he can not be the killer because a new victim has just been found stripped and strangled at the Monaco hotel .   At the Monaco ,  Grissom and  Catherine immediately notice several differences between this crime scene and the others . Autopsy finds that the woman was raped with something covered in leather . In interrogation ,  Grissom confronts the woman \\'s husband , Brad Walden , with  Grissom golf clubs , which were used to rape Walden \\'s wife .  Grissom caddy containing the clubs is locked with a key  Grissom keeps on  Grissom keychain , which the killer could n\\'t have had access to . Culpepper arrests Brad Walden for the murders of all four women . At the press conference ,  Grissom tells a reporter the strip strangler has not been arrested .

Catherine and  Grissom find  Grissom the bar where  Grissom works .  Grissom tells them  Grissom \\'s a gay prostitute and any number of people could have collected  Grissom DNA .  Grissom suspects the strip strangler has been planting the semen after storing it in old ketchup packets .   After reexamining the Hayes crime scene ,  Warrick has found lots of white cotton fibers .  Warrick has connected the white towels with the frequent low self - esteem of signature killers and concluded the towels may have come from a gym .

      "s05e06 ['Synopsis While investigating a chopped up body on the grounds of WLVU , the team finds out that they \\'re dealing with the Blue Paint Killer again . The case gets confusing when the team finds out that the victim was male . Shortly after that , they find another body belonging to a female .   Plot Victim : Johnny Blake ( deceased )   On the case : Entire team   During fraternity hell week Western Las Vegas University ( WLVU ) , a blindfolded pledge runs from the fraternity members .  Grissom trips and falls ; when  Grissom stands up ,  Grissom face is covered in  maggots . Due to  Grissom reputation as a bug expert ,  Grissom is called to the scene , where  Grissom talks to Eva , the head of the school \\'s department of agriculture . As  Grissom sifts through the first ,  Grissom finds a tooth .  Grissom then tells Eva that , based on the number of maggots ,  Grissom guesses that there is at least 100 pounds of flesh buried , which is roughly the size of an average college student .    Grissom and  Nick sift through the dirt and shovel up  maggots maggots . While a lot of people look on ,  Nick whispers to  Grissom that  Nick has a hard time believing that nobody would notice a corpse lying in the grass .  Grissom also notes that the tiny bones they are finding are each the same shape and size .  Grissom finds wood chips that are also the same size and quickly comes to a conclusion .  Grissom is able to find a mulching machine and talks to its operator , Walter Beerly .  Grissom swabs the inside of the machine and finds evidence of human blood .   The tooth recovered was a porcelain crown , so there was no viable DNA to extract . Instead ,  Grissom cuts open one of  maggots maggots to extract any flesh it ate . Elsewhere ,  Greg sifts through the dirt , maggots , and other debris recovered from the crime scene .  Greg tells  Catherine that , aside from dirt and maggots ,  Greg found shreds of black plastic from a garbage bag and something else with a sticky blue substance on it .  Catherine recognizes the item as a fingernail ; when  Catherine runs the fingernail for trace , it comes back as motor oil and blue paint - the same combination used by the \" Blue Paint Killer . \"   Brass briefs the entire department on the Blue Paint Killer - starting in 1987 , three women were killed on the campus of Western Las Vegas University ( WLVU ) . John Mathers was caught and sentenced to death for the murder of the third victim , Charlene Roth . On the night of the execution , the body of Debbie Reston was found with a similar M.O. used . It was concluded that John Mathers was a copycat and that the original killer is still on the loose . The suspect \\'s M.O. is to apply blue paint mixed with motor oil to a railing in order to prevent the paint from drying . The female victim will then use a nearby water fountain to wash the paint off ; there , the suspect will sexually assault the victim then kill them by strangulation .  Catherine adds that they figure the suspect is a male at least 35 years of age that wears glasses and may drive a Chevy with a black interior .   Lab tech Mia Dickerson tells Grissom that the DNA extracted from the maggot belonged to a male victim . Meanwhile , while still sifting through the dirt ,  Greg finds two halves of a key with a fraternity symbol on them .  Catherine and  Nick visit the university \\'s fraternity and are told that pledges swallow a key during hell week and retrieve it by the end of the week . When they ask if any pledges are missing , they are shown a photo of Jonathon Blake , or \"  Johnny . \"  Johnny has long blonde hair in  Johnny photo . They are told that  Johnny has been missing since pledge week and  Nick asks for  Johnny \\'s hair brush and toothbrush . Just then , two pledges come in ; as they put their hands in the air and recite a pledge ,  Nick notices that one of their hands has blue paint on it .    Catherine and  Grissom find the railing the pledge touched , and  Grissom notices that there is fresh cement under the railing .  Grissom guesses that the Blue Paint Killer is now installing railings as well as painting them . They spot a black trash bag under a nearby bench with blonde hair sticking out of it . As  Grissom opens it ,  Grissom finds a dummy .  Grissom exhaustingly tells  Catherine that the killer is now taunting  them . In the lab ,  them open the trash bag and remove the dummy . Inside of the dummy \\'s mouth ,  them find a folded up note and a blonde hair with it ; the note reads \" I HAVE HER . \"  Catherine notes that the killer likes to plant hairs as part of his signature and tells the team that the hair is belongs to Debbie Reston . When  Grissom processes the note ,  Grissom finds a drawing of a bound and gagged woman in the background . Based on the angles ,  Catherine guesses that the killer was seated in the front seat of the van and drew the victim while  Catherine was tied up in the back .  Catherine wonders aloud if the killer could n\\'t look his victim ( or victims ) directly in the eye . As the team looks over the drawing further , Nick realizes that the letters in the background are from a sign for The Erotica Boutique .   In the parking lot of the shop , they find a white Chevy van . The back doors are opened to reveal a dead female . There is an air pump on the floor that was likely used to inflate the dummy and beer bottles , which  Catherine guesses were used to rape the victim . This explains why semen was never left behind at any of the scenes . Inside the shop ,  Grissom talks to the clerk . The clerk tells him that all transactions are cash only ( no credit card receipts ) and that there are no security cameras .  Grissom finds a comic book in the magazine rack with a drawing style similar to the one they recovered from the paper . The clerk identifies the artist as \" Zippy Tee \" and confirms that he traded the artwork for one of the sex dolls . He has no information on Zippy , but tells  Grissom that Zippy is a white guy that looks to be in  Grissom 40 \\'s , has brown hair , and is a little shorter than  Grissom .   In autopsy , Doc Robbins tells  Catherine that the victim , still a Jane Doe , has all of the tell - tale signs of being a victim of the Blue Paint Killer - blue paint on the hand , evidence of sexual assault , and ligature marks around the neck .  Catherine notices the victim \\'s blonde hair and brings up a photo of Johnny Blake in the database ; the two victims have similar long blonde hair . This leads  Catherine to believe that the killer was targeting this specific female and that Johnny \\'s murder was a mistake .   The female victim is identified as Kaitlin Rackish , a student at the university .  Catherine talks to  Kaitlin \\'s roommate , Mandy Cooper , and asks  Catherine to recount the last day the two spent together . Mandy reveals that the two were taking a class called \" Introduction to the Female Form \" with professor Cody Lewis , who just happens to be one of the main suspects the team was looking at in the past .  Brass interrogates  Cody and shows  Cody the comic book cover from The Erotica Boutique , but  Cody says that the drawing is n\\'t  Cody and that the artist has no technique .  Cody tells  Brass that  Cody has come to the station voluntarily , but  Brass lays out the details -  Cody used to have a Chevy van ,  Cody dated the first victim ,  Cody return to campus coincided with the fourth murder , and  Kaitlin was in  Cody evening classes . Despite all of this evidence ,  Cody denies any involvement in the murders .  Cody also tells  Brass that no matter how much  Cody denies  Cody involvement , it seems that  everyone has made up  everyone minds already and labeled  Cody a serial killer .   Greg and Nick process the van from the boutique parking lot . Inside , they find a WLVU parking pass from 1986 and a pair of busted eyeglasses .  Nick notes that evidence indicates that Debbie Reston broke the killer \\'s glasses two years prior . They look further and find that the VIN number has been scratched off and the vehicle \\'s registration is expired .  Nick also sees that the registration sticker is a fake . Inside the back of the van ,  Greg finds something that looks like fingerprint powder under the carpet . Meanwhile , lab tech Jacqui Franco tells  Sara that the prints lifted from the dashboard and rearview mirror of the van match the partial print that was lifted from the trash bag Debbie Reston was found in two years ago . Elsewhere ,  Catherine and Warrick compare the lives of the five victims and find that none of them had one single thing in common ( where they ate , classes they took , etc . ) .    Sara studies the comic book pages frame by frame and takes down meticulous notes on what  Sara sees .  Nick brings  Grissom up to speed on their findings from the van - dead license plates , a tampered VIN number , and counterfeit registration stickers . However ,  Grissom finds out that the parking pass from 1986 belonged to John Mathers , who was executed for the murder of Charlene Roth .  Nick tells  Grissom that  Nick does n\\'t think  they \\'re looking at a killer and a copycat ; instead ,  they \\'re looking at partners in crime .    Nick watches an interview with John Mathers conducted a week before he was executed . He tells  Catherine that John was in prison for fifteen years and that his only visitor was his lawyer . Nothing in the file shows John in communication with his partner at any time .  Sara enters and informs them that the fingerprint recovered from the binding of the comic book was a match to the van and the garbage bag Debbie Reston was found in . After analyzing the drawings from the comic book ,  Sara determined that the artist is a dominant , disassociative sexual sadist .  Nick adds that the prison psychiatrist diagnosed John as a psychopath with a dependent personality disorder . This leads  Catherine to wonder if John was the submissive in the partnership and his partner was the dominant . They all wonder why there was a murder on the night before John \\'s execution and one on the two - year anniversary of the execution , but not one a year before . David Hodges interrupts and says that the black powder found in the van is ink made exclusively for commercial copy machines . A light bulb goes off in  Catherine \\'s head and  Catherine is able to trace three different victims to the campus copy union .    Brass finds out that one of the employees of the copy union , Kevin Greer , fits the killer \\'s profile and has been working there for more than ten years . Inside the copy union , an employee tells  Brass that  Kevin just left work .  Catherine finds black powder in a black trash bag and the employee tells  Catherine that  Kevin uses the nearby machine to bind  Kevin comic books . The police get a warrant to search  Kevin \\'s house ; inside the dimly lit residence are some pictures of women and a paint mixer .  Catherine says that  Kevin mixed  Kevin own paint so that the lab could n\\'t trace its point of purchase . Just then , the phone rings and the answering machine picks up .  Kevin is on the other end of the line , and  Kevin commends the police for a job well done .  Kevin adds that  Kevin will wait for them at the police station while they look around  Kevin house .   In the station interrogation room ,  Kevin sits and waits with  Kevin sketch pad .  Kevin is a skinny white male with a mustache and yellowing teeth .  Grissom and Brass enter and  Kevin greets each of them by their first names .  Grissom tells them that  Grissom rule was that if the police were able to make it to  Grissom house , they deserved to meet  Grissom in person .  Kevin brags about  Kevin murders and says that  Kevin would gradually strangle  Kevin victims instead of doing it in one shot .  Grissom asks  Kevin where  Grissom glasses are and  Kevin replies that after Debbie broke  Kevin glasses ,  Kevin got LASIK surgery . However , the surgery did n\\'t take , which resulted in poor night vision . This explains why  Kevin missed the one year anniversary of John \\'s execution and why  Kevin mistook Johnny for  Kaitlin .  Kevin tells  Brass that  Kevin tried to talk John out of killing Charlene Roth , but could n\\'t . John was caught and sent to prison ;  Kevin admits that he could never find a solid replacement for him .  Kevin continues to draw in  Kevin sketch pad during the entire interrogation .   Meanwhile , in John \\'s garage ,  Catherine and  Sara find a freezer with drawings of the victims and some locks of their hair in plastic bags . However , there are six victims listed . One of the victims , Brit Mosscoe , is one they have n\\'t accounted for yet .  Catherine fills  Grissom in on the findings . With this information ,  Grissom asks  Kevin where Brit Mosscoe is .  Kevin replies that  Kevin can take the police to  Catherine , but they will need a full tank of gas to get there . As they get ready to leave the station ,  Kevin asks to use the bathroom . Meanwhile , back in  Kevin \\'s garage ,  Sara finds that WLVU never had a student named Brit Mosscoe .  Sara looks at Brit \\'s drawing and sees a calendar on the wall with a photo that looks similar to the drawing . The woman in the calendar photo is identified as Miss October , and  Sara is able to eventually figure out that Brit Mosscoe is an anagram for Miss October . She frantically calls  Catherine with this information , and  Catherine passes it along to  Grissom .  Grissom wonders where  Kevin is taking  them if Brit Mosscoe does n\\'t exist .    them go to the bathroom and open the stall  Kevin was in .  Kevin is lying on the floor of the stall with a black plastic trash bag around  Kevin head .  Grissom tries to give  Kevin CPR , but  Kevin has killed  Kevin via suffocation . After the ordeal ,  Grissom walks back to the interrogation room and looks at  Kevin \\'s sketch pad .  Kevin has drawn an image of  Grissom with various images of  Grissom being tortured and scared in the reflection of  Grissom \\'s glasses .  Grissom turns the drawing on its side and sees smaller images of the victims in similar states of terror .  Grissom then turns the drawing back around and tri - folds it to reveal a larger drawing of  Grissom . In the image of the glasses , there is a man with the final words coming out of  Grissom mouth : GOOD BYE .  Grissom looks at the drawing in shock .']\n",
      "s05e13 ['Synopsis When two bodies covered in tar are found , the CSIs must try to uncover the identity and the murderers . Sara is reprimanded by Ecklie for improper conduct .   Plot Victim : Svetlana Melton ( deceased )   On the case : Catherine Willows , Nick Stokes , Sara Sidle , Warrick Brown   At a construction site , a body is found buried and encased in roofing tar . As  Nick and Warrick brush away dirt from the body ,  Nick finds a third foot , indicating that there \\'s another body buried in the spot . The large block of tar and rock containing the two bodies are brought into the lab . David Phillips is able to get x - rays of the bodies , revealing that both victims are female . One of the victims has something that looks like barbed wire in her mouth . Doc Robbins guesses that it could be dental work , but  Catherine wonders if it \\'s some kind of torture device .    Catherine has trouble determining how to get the bodies out of the large block without damaging it . Grissom , who tells  Catherine  he is off the clock and came into work early just to see this large block in person , has an idea .  he has  Catherine drill holes into the block and put funnels in the holes . Noting that  tar becomes as brittle as glass at -200 degrees Fahrenheit ,  Grissom pours liquid nitrogen into the funnels causing  tar tar to gloss over . They are then able to chisel away  tar excess tar to get to the bodies . However , when pulling tar away from the second body , part of the victim \\'s skull becomes stuck to  tar tar and rips away from the rest of the skeleton . Remembering that  Grissom shift is about to start ,  Grissom leaves and tells  Catherine that  Sara can assist  Sara .    Sara reconstructs the face of the topmost victim from the entombment . Catherine ,  Nick and Warrick join  Sara and go over their findings so far . The victim \\'s cause of death was blunt force trauma to the skull and  Sara had blood on  Sara shirt , which could belong to the victim or a suspect .  Nick adds that the wire removed from the victim \\'s mouth was 26-gauge stainless steel that is used to wire jawbones shut .  Sara notices an x - ray of the fingers , and  Catherine tells  Sara that all of the fingers were cut off both of the victims \\' hands with a tool that is jagged on one side and smooth on the other . If  this was done perimortem ,  this might be torture ; if  this was postmortem , it could have been done to hide the victims \\' identities . David Hodges interrupts and tells the group that , based on the soil samples collected , the bottom victim was buried five years ago , while the top victim has only been buried for two .  Sara believes that both murders point to domestic abuse .    Sara visits multiple hospitals in Vegas to find domestic abuse victims from two years ago that match  Sara mold . As  Sara looks through the various photos of victims ,  Sara hears voices in  Sara head and is clearly agitated by what  Sara \\'s looking at .  Sara finally comes across a photo that looks like  Sara mold ; the corresponding records indicate that the victim is Svetlana Melton .   Svetlana \\'s ex - husband , Andrew Melton , arrives at the station for questioning along with his young Asian wife , June . As  Andrew sits down for interrogation ,  Sara gives him a death stare . He tells  Catherine and  Sara that he last saw Svetlana two years ago and that he was arrested for hitting  Sara , something he says he never did .  Andrew also never filed a missing persons report , worried about how that would look after being accused of abuse .  Sara continues to bluntly ask questions and make assumptions while  Catherine glares across the table at  Catherine .  Andrew tells them that  Andrew met Svetlana through an \" agency , \" which  Andrew refuses to call mail - order .  Sara accuses  Andrew of murder point blank and guesses he got tired of white women . Catherine \\'s jaw drops as the interview unravels and  Andrew leaves with his wife .   As they walk through the hallway ,  Sara asks that a police officer be sent to  Andrew \\'s residence to conduct regular welfare checks despite there being no evidence that  June is being abused .  Sara becomes agitated when  Catherine says there \\'s nothing  they can do until  they build a case against  Andrew for Svetlana \\'s murder . The two get into an argument with  Catherine telling  Sara that  Catherine goes off the deep end every time  they get a case with a hint of domestic violence or abuse .  Sara fires back and tells  Catherine that  Sara lets  Sara sexuality to cloud  Sara judgement about men . Conrad Ecklie hears the commotion and angrily calls  Sara into his office .   In his office , Ecklie tells  Sara that he expects  Sara to conduct  Sara as a representative of the lab and the city .  Sara , clearly not having any , shuts Ecklie down before he can give one of his \" for the good of the lab \" speeches . He pulls out  Sara file and tells  Sara that  Sara berates witnesses , disrespect the people  Sara works with , and was able to luck  Sara way out of a DUI . After  Sara tells Ecklie that he \\'s only in charge of the lab because he could n\\'t make it in the field and because Grissom does n\\'t kiss ass , Ecklie suspends her for a week without pay .    Warrick processes  Svetlana \\'s jacket from the night  Svetlana was admitted to the hospital . Most of the blood on the jacket is  Svetlana \\'s , but there is some blood from an unknown male contributor .  Catherine guesses that the blood belongs to  Andrew ; however ,  Warrick tells  Catherine that  Andrew voluntarily submitted a DNA sample on the night of the incident and that it does n\\'t match the blood on the jacket .  Warrick has also found a dictionary with certain romantic words highlighted . A set of camera booth photos featuring  Svetlana and another guy is being used as a bookmark .  Catherine tells  Warrick that the guy in the pictures is not Andrew .    Nick processes  Svetlana \\'s blouse and jeans , telling  Warrick that the large amount of blood is because head wounds gush . There is a piece of paper in the jeans pocket ; however , the elements have erased away the writing .  Warrick shows Nick the pocket of the jeans and they see that the ink from the note bled onto the lining .  Nick has Ronnie Litre process the writing on the lining and they see that it reads \" Madame Matryoshka \\'s . Tuesday , Eight A.M. \" Ronnie explains that matryoshka are Russian nesting dolls .    Nick and Brass visit Madame Matryoshka \\'s , which happens to be a beauty shop . They are introduced to the owner , Chloe Daniels , who remembers  Svetlana working there as a hairdresser .  Svetlana soon admits that  Svetlana hires  women as hairdressers but  women are , in reality , wives - to - be for  Svetlana clients . The women are sponsored on a 90-day visa and taught a trade , which is cutting hair for men .  Chloe tells Brass that  Chloe does n\\'t screen the guys that the women end up with and  Nick tells  Chloe that  Svetlana ended up dead .  Chloe recognizes the guy from the camera booth photo as Ken Wellstone , but says that  Ken only came in for haircuts .    Nick and Brass pay  Ken a visit .  Ken remembers  Svetlana and remembers taking  Svetlana out for ice cream one day .  Svetlana then gave  Ken a story about having an abusive husband and begged  Ken for help , but  Ken did nothing . They ask  Ken for a DNA sample and  Nick searches the apartment .  Nick finds a black spot on the carpet under the dining room table and cuts a swatch to bring back to the lab for analysis .    Grissom visits  Sara and tells  Sara that Ecklie wants to fire  Sara .  Grissom wants to know why  Sara lost  Sara temper and notes that it has been happening quite a bit recently .  Sara admits that  Sara has a problem with authority and is self - destructive .  Sara tells  Grissom that  Sara also crossed the line with  Catherine and was insubordinate to Ecklie .  Grissom asks  Sara why , but  Sara wants  Grissom to leave it alone .  Grissom does not and wants to know why  Sara is so angry .  Sara opens up about  Sara past and growing up in an abusive household , culminating in  Sara mother killing  Sara abusive father and getting taken by Child Services .   In the lab , David Hodges processes the piece of carpet taken from  Ken \\'s apartment . The spot on the carpet tests positive for the same tar  Svetlana was buried in ; furthermore , the unknown male DNA on  Sara jacket is a match to  Ken .  Ken is brought in for questioning , where  Ken shows  Brass a note from  Svetlana telling  Ken that  Svetlana was running away .  Ken finds it odd that the note refers to  Ken as \"  Ken \" because  Svetlana always called  Ken \" Kenski . \"  Ken tells  Brass that  Ken and  Svetlana were in love ; however ,  Andrew had bought  Svetlana , so  Andrew thought  Andrew owned  Svetlana .  Svetlana wanted to divorce  Andrew and frame  Andrew for abuse , so  Svetlana had  Ken hit  Svetlana in the face . This explains  Svetlana broken jaw and  Ken \\'s blood on  Svetlana jacket .    Warrick informs  Catherine that the blood on  Svetlana \\'s shirt belonged to  Svetlana herself with no contributions from  Ken .  Ken also found traces of \" Aubergine Sheen number 315 , \" a professional grade hair dye .  Warrick believes that some of the patterns look like cast - off . Catherine ,  Nick and Brass head to the hair salon with a warrant to search the premises . There ,  Catherine finds a pair of scissors that are jagged on one side and smooth on the other .  Nick finds an appointment book and snaps a photo of it . There is blood spatter on the wall next to the aubergine hair dye that seems too low for  Svetlana \\'s height .  Nick wonders if  Svetlana was sitting when the attack happened . They see that the two chairs next to each other do n\\'t match ; when  Catherine removes the vinyl from one of the chairs , a large smudge is revealed .   In the lab ,  Warrick tells  Catherine that the smudge on the chair was Aubergine Sheen hair dye ; however , the blood stains on the wall were too degraded to get a DNA match .  Warrick is able to digitally match the smudge to  Svetlana \\'s face from  Svetlana camera booth photo .  Catherine notices that the necklace  Svetlana is wearing in the photo is the same one that  Andrew \\'s new wife , June , was wearing when  Catherine visited the police station earlier . This is enough for a warrant to search  Andrew \\'s home . There , they find that  Andrew has locked the doors to the refrigerator and the kitchen cupboards , seemingly as a way to control  Andrew wife \\'s weight . The cord has also been detached from the phone , so  Catherine can not make any calls . In the living room ,  Brass removes  June \\'s necklace while  Andrew angrily looks on .    Catherine processes the necklace and finds  Svetlana \\'s blood on it . Catherine ,  Nick and  Warrick meet up to recap the case .  Nick guesses that after spending a night in jail on a phony abuse charge ,  Andrew immediately went looking for  Svetlana .  Warrick adds that  Andrew found  Svetlana and killed  Svetlana , taking the only thing  Warrick valued - the necklace . They know that this evidence wo n\\'t hold up in court , so they need to find the murder weapon .  Catherine says a murder weapon will be hard to find since the crime is over two years old .  Nick wonders if  Andrew is even the one who buried the body , as there was already a pre - existing grave at the site . They figure that the girls \\' fingertips were removed by blending shears from the salon , and the only people with access to the salon are  Chloe and  Chloe receptionist , Vlad .   Ronnie Litre compares the handwriting from the appointment book and the note  Svetlana wrote to  Ken .  Ken finds that the letters are a match , meaning that the handwriting on both is Vlad \\'s . In the interrogation room ,  Warrick reveals that  Vlad \\'s credit card receipts show that  Warrick bought large amounts of tar two and five years ago .  Vlad admits that  Vlad worked for a certain family when  Vlad was in  Russia , and when they wanted a body taken care of ,  Vlad would go to the oil field and bury it in tar .  Vlad tells  Warrick that  Svetlana was already dead ; a flashback shows  Vlad walking in on  Andrew kneeling over the body and removing  Svetlana necklace .  Andrew then paid  Vlad a lot of money to clean up the scene and bury the body . After burying the body ,  Vlad wrote the fake note and left it in  Ken \\'s apartment , tracking tar onto the carpet .  Warrick tells  Warrick that there was another body in the grave , and  Vlad reveals that five years ago , another girl had come over from  Russia hidden in a suitcase because she could n\\'t get a visa . She got crushed to death as other luggage was piled on top of her and  Vlad buried her in tar in the desert .  Vlad insists that  Vlad only does this with the girls that are already dead and that  Vlad did n\\'t kill anyone .    Brass interrogates  Andrew and pretends to sympathize with  Vlad situation . \" Women can really drive you crazy , huh ? \" he asks  Andrew .  Andrew admits to eventually not letting  Svetlana leave the house because  Andrew felt other guys were ogling  Svetlana when they would go out .  Andrew tells  Brass that  Svetlana eventually got lonely . A flashback shows  Andrew entering the salon and confronting  Svetlana for the bogus abuse charge .  Andrew threw the dish of hair dye in  Svetlana face , hit  Svetlana , and pushed  Svetlana into the chair . The confrontation ends with  Andrew beating  Svetlana to death .    Grissom visits with Ecklie and tells  Grissom that  Grissom is not firing  Sara , saying that  Sara behavior is a direct result of  Grissom management .  Grissom tells Ecklie that  Sara is a great criminalist and that  Grissom needs  Sara . Ecklie says that  Sara is a loose cannon with a gun , but relents and lets  Sara keep  Sara job under  Grissom \\'s supervision .']\n",
      "s05e22 ['Synopsis After a tough day on the job ,  Catherine heads to a bar to unwind and has a brief romantic encounter with a stranger , Adam Novak . When a woman from the same bar turns up dead later that night , evidence points to Novak as the lead suspect in the murder investigation . Friction arises between Grissom and  Catherine when  Catherine fails to disclose  Catherine knowledge of the suspect . Meanwhile ,  Catherine deals with cross contamination of evidence in the DNA lab .   Plot Victim : Alice Granger ( deceased )   On the case : Entire team   In the lab ,  Catherine hands Mia Dickerson two DNA samples from a husband and wife who got into it with each other , resulting in the husband killing the wife . After a long shift ,  Catherine asks Nick and Warrick if they want to go out for a drink , but they both take rain checks .  Catherine goes to the Highball bar , where  Catherine meets Adam Novak . The two share some drinks and small talk before  Catherine calls it a night .  Adam writes  Adam phone number down on a matchbook and gives it to  Catherine .  Adam then walks  Catherine to  Catherine car , but does n\\'t take it well when  Catherine gets ready to leave , holding  Catherine car door shut .  Adam finally lets go when  Catherine pulls it and the door hits  Catherine in the face and tells  Catherine that  Catherine \\'s not worth the trouble .    Catherine , now at home , gets a call to go to a crime scene , as  Catherine is backing up the grave shift .  Catherine meets  Grissom at the murder scene of Alice Granger , who has been shot with a small caliber weapon .  Catherine face is covered with a jacket , indicating that the killer was familiar with the victim .  Alice \\'s car is gone , pointing to a possible carjacking . Det .  Vartann arrives and tells them that the car has been found ;  Catherine follows  Vartann to the location . Much to  Catherine \\'s surprise , the car has been found in the parking lot of the Highball .  Catherine searches the car and finds a gun under one of the seats .  Grissom wonders if the perpetrator killed Alice , stole the car and stopped off for a drink .  Catherine seems less than enthusiastic about stepping foot back inside the bar .   An officer tells  Vartann that all of the cars in the lot are accounted for except for  Alice \\'s . The bartender recognizes  Alice from the photo  Vartann shows  Catherine and says that  Catherine had been in the bar a few times , including the night before .  Catherine walks up and the bartender seems to remember  Catherine ; however ,  Catherine gives  Catherine the signal to keep it quiet .  Alice got drunk and had the bartender call  Alice a cab ; the bartender did so and called Lucky Cab . This explains why the car is still in the parking lot , but it does n\\'t explain the gun .  Catherine thanks the bartender for  Catherine discretion .   In autopsy , Doc Robbins pulls a .25 caliber bullet from  Alice .  Grissom is disappointed , as this rules out the .22 caliber gun found in the car . It is determined that  Alice was shot at close range ; scrapes on  Alice knees indicate that  Alice might have been kneeling and begging for  Alice life .   Catherine and Sara  Alice  Alice \\'s clothes and personal effects . Under a magnifying glass ,  Catherine finds something on the jacket and says that  Catherine \\'ll collect it and send it to  Hodges .  Catherine , meanwhile , goes through  Alice \\'s personal effects and finds a matchbook with a phone number on it .  Catherine asks to see  it and  Catherine mind immediately goes to  Catherine encounter with Adam .  Catherine excuses  Catherine under the guise of going to pick up  Lindsey and goes home to search frantically for the matchbook ; however , the  Catherine threw  it away and the garbage has already been picked up . While looking for the matchbook , a frantic  Catherine gets a lecture from  Catherine mother about always working and not spending time with  Lindsey .    Hodges tells Grissom that the material recovered from  Alice \\'s jacket was balls of metal consistent with automotive sheet metal . The metallic balls would have been released into the air during the welding process . The killer could be someone who worked with cars and  Hodges notes that  Alice worked in a car dealership .    Greg relays the information to  Catherine that the bullet recovered from  Alice was a .25 caliber , ruling out the gun found in the car .  Catherine already knew this , but  Greg adds that  Alice \\'s gun was registered to  Catherine brother ,  Douglas .    Douglas is brought in for interrogation and tells  Catherine and Vartann that  Jeff sister had a stalker named Jeff Simon .  Alice had changed  Alice phone number several times , changed jobs and moved half a dozen times ; however ,  Jeff was always able to find  Alice .  Jeff gave  Alice the .22 caliber the week before in order to protect  Alice and helped  Alice file a restraining order against  Jeff .    Catherine and  Vartann visit  Jeff at  Jeff job in a junkyard where  Jeff is a welder .  Jeff insists that  Jeff is n\\'t bothering  Alice and that  Jeff just wants to get back with  Alice . When told that  Alice is dead ,  Jeff staggers around and sits down in shock , claiming that  Jeff has n\\'t been near  Alice since the restraining order .  Catherine searches  Jeff \\'s truck and finds a laptop that has a map and a tracking location . The location turns out to be the lab ;  Catherine calls  Grissom with the information and  Grissom finds a GPS tracker under the rear bumper of  Alice \\'s car .   In interrogation ,  Vartann tells  Jeff that  Jeff fingerprints are all over the GPS tracker .  Jeff again says that  Jeff loved  Alice and that  Jeff was following  Alice because  Jeff was worried about  Alice .  Alice ,  Jeff claims , was a partier with a drinking problem who needed to be looked after . When told that  Alice took a cab home ,  Jeff denies this and says that  Alice got into a dark - colored Chrysler or Buick .  Jeff followed them but lost track of them after getting pulled over for speeding . When confronted with the evidence of automotive sheet metal on  Alice \\'s jacket ,  Jeff says that they spent every moment together before the restraining order was issued .  Jeff tells  Catherine and  Vartann that their concern should be about the guy Alice got into the car with .  Jeff describes the driver as a sleazy guy with a slight build , dark hair and a leather jacket .  Catherine immediately flashes back to the bar and remembers that Adam was wearing a leather jacket .    Catherine tries to talk to  Grissom about  Catherine possible involvement in the case , but there are bigger matters to attend to .  Catherine tells them that the same unknown male DNA has been found in three different cases including the Alice Granger case and the husband / wife case  Catherine was working at the very beginning of the episode . There appears to be cross contamination and all of the DNA evidence collected over the last two days has to be resubmitted and retested .    Catherine sits in  Catherine office contemplating everything going on . Greg interrupts  Catherine train of thought and tells  Catherine that  Jeff has been released from custody . The cop that pulled  Jeff over for speeding confirmed  Jeff alibi , meaning that  they can only get  Jeff for stalking .  Catherine also comes in and tells  Catherine that  they got a hit off of the phone number found on the matchbook and that the person has been brought in for questioning .   That person is Adam Novak , who sits across the interrogation table from Grissom and Vartann . He recognizes  Alice from  Alice photo and remembers that he bought  Alice a drink the night before . They have  Adam recount the events of the night and  Adam starts off by saying that  Adam had dinner and went to the Highball , where  Adam met a redhead . Just then ,  Catherine comes in and introduces  Catherine .  Adam stops  Adam telling  Adam story and tells Grissom and Vartann to ask \" the redhead \" what happened next . They both look at  Catherine in disbelief .    Catherine and  Grissom watch the rest of the interrogation from behind the two - way glass .  Adam recounts  Adam evening with  Catherine up to and including sharing a kiss and getting rejected .  Grissom asks  Catherine about this and  Catherine tells  Adam that  Adam is speaking truthfully .  Catherine explains that the mark on  Catherine face was an accident and that  Adam is n\\'t the guy  Catherine thought  Adam was when they first met .  Grissom is understandably upset that  Grissom was kept out of the loop regarding  Catherine potential involvement in the case .  Grissom tells  Catherine that  Catherine needs to recuse  Catherine from the case ; since  Adam is a lawyer ,  Grissom could claim prejudicial treatment . Meanwhile ,  Adam refuses to tell  Vartann what kind of car  Adam drives and states that  Adam will remain silent until  Adam retains counsel .   Next , it \\'s Ecklie \\'s turn to hear  Catherine \\'s recollection of  Catherine evening . Despite having received a memo from  Catherine outlining the events ,  Grissom wants a firsthand account .  Catherine defiantly says that  Catherine only had one drink and that  Catherine did n\\'t have sex with  Adam .  Adam did not handle  Catherine rejection well and went back inside the bar . A flashback shows  Adam going back into the Highball and finding a drunk  Alice at the bar .  Catherine theorizes to Ecklie that  Adam walked a complaint  Alice outside and offered to drive  Alice home . They are interrupted by Warrick , who says that there is a crime scene in Seven Hills they need to head to .   At the scene , they find a female victim with a jacket over  Alice head , similar to  Alice \\'s crime scene . The victim , Holly Pearson , lived across the street . There was no sexual assault and all of her personal belongings have been accounted for . David Phillips removes the jacket and finds that  Holly also died from a single gunshot wound to the head , only this time , the angle is different .  Warrick finds a shell casing nearby and , based on footprints ,  Catherine surmises that both  Holly and  Holly killer were running . A keycard for the Clark County Courthouse is found , as well , and  Catherine notes that  Adam is a public defender .  Catherine fills Det .  Vega in on  Alice \\'s case and has  Vega check to see if  Holly went to the Highball the night before ;  Vega is later able to confirm that this was the case .    Holly \\'s coworkers tell  Catherine and  Vega that they went to the Highball to celebrate  Holly \\'s recent promotion . After  Holly called it a night ,  Holly took a cab home while  Holly friends continued to have a good time .  Catherine shows them a set of six photos and the girls recognize  Adam from  Adam photo . They remember that  Adam brought them a round of drinks and tried to get friendly . However , after  Holly left , they do n\\'t remember seeing  Adam for the rest of the night .   In autopsy , Doc Robbins tells  Catherine that  Holly \\'s cause of death was a gunshot wound to the back of the head . Lack of gunpowder and stippling suggests that  Catherine was not shot at close range . The bullet recovered from  Catherine body was a .25 caliber - the same caliber used in  Alice \\'s murder .  Holly \\'s stomach contents contained only two things : a small amount of wine and human flesh . Doc Robbins says that the flesh has taste buds on it , indicating that  Holly bit  Holly attacker \\'s tongue when he tried to make a move .    Warrick processes the bullets from both cases and finds that they were fired from the same gun .  Nick enters and tells  Nick that the keycard found belonged to Adam Novak and that the only prints on the card were  Adam \\'s .    Catherine drives home and is horrified to see  Adam in front of  Catherine house talking to  Catherine mother and  Lindsey .  Catherine dials 911 , sets the phone down and steps out of the car . While  Adam continues to be cordial ,  Catherine signals  Catherine to mother to take  Lindsey and head into the house immediately . When they are alone ,  Adam accuses  Catherine of trying to set  Adam up for murder just because  Adam came on too strong at the bar . As the sound of police sirens grows louder ,  Adam takes a step towards  Catherine , causing  Catherine to draw  Catherine gun . The police arrive and  Adam curses at  Catherine ;  Catherine replies that  Adam showed up to  Catherine house .    Adam is brought in for interrogation again .  Grissom has  Adam stick out  Grissom tongue ; when  Grissom does ,  Grissom reveals some teeth marks on it .  Adam admits that  Adam gave  Alice a ride home the night of  Alice murder and that things got \" hot and heavy . \" Afterwards ,  Alice got out of the car and  Grissom drove off .  Grissom then went to the Highball again the next night , got drunk and came on to  Holly ; however ,  Grissom came on too strong ( again ) , tried to kiss  Holly and got bitten on the tongue instead .  Adam \\'s lawyer is able to back up  Grissom claim that  Holly took a cab and was dropped off at  Holly home alone . When told that his keycard was found at the crime scene ,  Adam claims that  Adam never left  Adam car and should still be in  Adam center console . The car is at CSI for processing .   In the garage ,  Nick tells  Catherine that  Nick checked the center console and did n\\'t find a keycard .  Catherine believes  Adam is lying again , but  Nick shows  Catherine evidence that  Adam \\'s car was recently broken into . It seems possible that someone broke in , stole the keycard and locked the car back up without  Adam noticing .  Nick says that  Nick found some smudges and partials both inside and outside of the car .   The prints come back to Jeff Simon , Alice \\'s stalker .  Catherine and Vartann go to talk to  Nick again at the junkyard .  Jeff again claims  Jeff has an alibi since  Jeff got pulled over by the cops for speeding , but  Catherine says that  Jeff still knew where  Alice lived . A flashback shows an angry and distraught  Jeff watching  Adam and  Alice making out ; when  Catherine got out of the car and  Adam drove off ,  Adam approached  Catherine and shot  Catherine as  Catherine tried to run away .  Adam then went back to the Highball the following night knowing that  Adam frequented the place . While  Adam was trying to hit on  Holly ,  Jeff broke into  Jeff car and stole the keycard .  Jeff then followed  Holly to  Holly house , shot  Holly and planted the keycard to incriminate  Adam .    Holly informs  Grissom that the evidence contamination occurred because someone at the manufacturer coughed or sneezed on what was supposed to be a sterile product and got their DNA everywhere . Meanwhile ,  Catherine jokingly asks  Grissom out for a drink , but  Grissom continues to give  Catherine the cold shoulder .  Catherine asks if it \\'s a crime to go out after work and have a little human contact .  Grissom replies that this is why  Grissom does n\\'t go out .']\n",

Sara arrives on the scene to assist  Greg while David Phillips looks over the body of the boy in the trash bin . David believes that the boy died less than 24 hours ago ; however , the body looks like it has begun to mummify and  Sara notices how thin the boy looks .  Sara instructs a clearly shaken  Greg to transport the body carefully to the lab . Back at the original scene ,  Grissom then tells  Sofia that it is not their job to chase after suspects ; however ,  Sara tells  Grissom that  Sara knew the suspect would drop the gun while running , so  Sara was chasing the evidence .  Sara shows  Grissom the gun  Sara recovered and says that all they have to do is match the weapon to both victims .   The boy in the trash bin is brought into autopsy . After being removed from the bin ,  Sara collects hairs of off the body .  Greg processes the trash bin and finds a yellow powder along with some fingernail scratch marks . Doc Robbins goes over his findings with  Sara and determines that the boy was around five years old . He has several fractures that wound indicate abuse and Doc Robbins guesses that they occurred no more than six months ago .  Sara again notes how thin the boy looks and the doc tells  Sara the cause of death was renal failure due to starvation . The only thing found in the boy \\'s intestines were some brown flecks that the doc collected . He tells  Sara that the boy \\'s body basically digested itself , something that would take weeks to happen , not one day .    Sofia tells  Sara that  Sara ran the boy \\'s DNA through the missing persons database , but got no hits .  Sara is n\\'t surprised , saying that if his parents did n\\'t care enough to feed him , they would n\\'t care enough to report him missing . Based on the age of the boy and the age and pattern of the fractures ,  Sara has gone through Child Protective Services reports and found ten possible matches to the boy \\'s possible identity .  Sofia offers to help look through the files , but  Sara does n\\'t seem to trust  Sara .   Mia Dickerson tells  Sofia that one of the hairs collected from the boy still had skin tags attached to  it and that she needs something to compare  it to .  Sara also says that some of the hairs were synthetic , possibly from a doll , wig , or fake fur . The hairs were sent to trace . Meanwhile ,  Sara visits Doc Robbins with facial x - rays of the candidates  Sara thinks could be a match to the boy . The doc tells  Sara that sinus identification is as reliable as  fingerprints because  fingerprints are unique . He compares the sinus x - rays to the x - ray of the boy and  fingerprints find a match - Devon Malton , age five , whose last address was a foster home run by a Lorna Tenney .    Sara and Brass visit Lorna , who s tells them that  Devon has n\\'t lived with  Sara in six months , which  Sara notes is when he fractured his arm .  Lorna says that  Lorna was cleared by Child Protective Services and that the records indicating that  Devon still lives there are wrong .  Lorna denies  Sara and Brass entry into  Lorna house without a warrant and refuses to answer any questions without an attorney present . Meanwhile , while fuming the trash bin ,  Greg is paged by David Hodges . After Hodges chastises him for being involved in a shooting , he tells  Greg that the substance found on the inside of the trash bin was cheap makeup . Additionally , the substance found in  Devon \\'s intestinal tract was lead - based paint chips , popular in the 1970s .  Greg notes that most of the houses and apartments in the neighborhood look like they were built around that time .   Several foster children sit in the station waiting room while  Brass questions  Lorna and  Lorna attorney .  Sara enters and speaks to Glynnis Carson , who looks to be the oldest child present .  Glynnis shoots down  Sara \\'s lame attempt to bond with  Sara . After  Sara apologizes ,  Sara admits that  Sara was in the system for a while when  Sara was growing up .  Glynnis tells  Sara that  Sara has been in the system for ten years and has lived in several foster homes . Despite  Lorna \\'s tough exterior ,  Glynnis insists that  Glynnis is actually one of the nicer foster parents  Glynnis has had .  Sara asks  Sara if  Sara remembers Devon ;  Glynnis replies that  Sara does and that Devon \\'s mother actually came to pick him up six months ago , which never happens .  Sara also tells  Sara that  Devon had two other brothers named Kevin and Raymond who also lived in the foster home .    Sara and Brass speak to Delia Brooks from Child Protective Services . Delia tells them that  Devon \\'s mother , Candice , served time in prison for smashing a brick into her ex - boyfriend \\'s face . Her children were placed into foster care and when  Candice served most of  Candice sentence and was released ,  Candice immediately picked the boys up .  Candice \\'s whereabouts are currently unknown .  Sara asks why Child Protective Services did n\\'t follow up , and Delia replies that they ca n\\'t follow up on every case and that all signs pointed towards  Candice being a good mother .  Sara disagrees , as one child is dead and the other two are missing .    Greg shows  Sofia that  Greg has found a fingerprint inside the lip of the trash bin ; however ,  Greg is unsure how to lift it for processing .  Sofia is able to reconstruct the print using the digital photos that  Greg has taken .  Sofia also assures  Greg that it \\'s okay to destroy the evidence and cut the trash bin in order to recover the print , so long as  Greg documents everything  Greg did .  Sofia runs the print , expands it to the FBI database , and finds that the print has come back to a Private First Class Phillip Riley . Phillip is brought in for questioning . He tells  Brass that he decided to party before his leave and did so with a woman named Divine he met at a club called Seven Sins . After he finished partying , he took out the trash . Phillip does n\\'t know  Divine \\'s address and tells  Brass that he went to her house in a taxi and left the same way .   Sara and Brass pay a visit to the Seven Sins club and find  Divine . She is wearing a wig , and Sara notes that the hair is consistent with the hair found on  Devon \\'s body .  Divine then reluctantly opens her mouth to give a DNA sample . She is brought to the station for questioning , where it is revealed that the hair from her wig is a match to the hair pulled from  Devon . Sara reveals that  Divine has seven alleles in common with Devon , which indicates some relation to  him . This caused  Brass to dig deeper and  him found out that  Divine had several aliases , one of which is Darlene Malton .  Darlene admits that  Darlene  Candice is  Candice cousin and that  Candice was left with the three kids and no money to take  care of  care .  Darlene also says that  Darlene did n\\'t hand the kids off to Child Services because  Devon got hurt there the last time and  Candice would be mad that  Darlene decided to do so . In order to get a lawyer to represent  Darlene ,  Darlene provides the address to where the kids are .   At the address ,  Brass finds a note in the house that from  Candice that included $ 300 to take care of the kids , but  Darlene used it on a new television . There is a locked storage shed in the backyard ;  Brass unlocks it and goes down with  Greg and  Sara in tow . Downstairs in the shed , they find Kevin and Raymond , one of which is barely alive . The other boy grabs Sara \\'s shoulder and  Darlene tells him that they \\'re safe now . Back in the station ,  Darlene is arrested .  Brass tells  Sara that  Candice distraught  Candice is flying in from Seattle and  Candice unsure as to whether to take  Darlene to hospital or the morgue first .  Sara tells  Candice that  Candice should take  Darlene to the hospital to see  Darlene kids , as the dead can wait .   In the end ,  Sara types  Sara mother \\'s name into the research database and looks up  Sara court case .   Victim : Samuel Mendez ( alive )   On the case : Catherine Willows , Nick Stokes , Warrick Brown , Louis Vartann    Nick and Warrick meet Det . Vartann in a prison where an prisoner , Samuel Mendez , has been beaten and is now brain dead . According to Vartann ,  suspects wait in central holding before being escorted to  suspects cell . There ,  suspects prisoners assaulted the officers by throwing feces at them , and this led to the cops going in and beating  suspects prisoners to quell the riot . Excessive force may have been used on  Samuel , but Vartann believes there were mitigating circumstances .  Warrick spots a gun on the floor and Vartann tells  Warrick that it was found under  Samuel \\'s body . An overflowed toilet shows  Nick and  Warrick the ammunition  suspects prisoners were working with .    suspects prisoners are lined up and processed . A few of  suspects tell  Nick that  Samuel was new to the prison and that the police \" gutted  Nick like a fish . \" One of  suspects prisoners has several bruises on  Nick face and tells  Nick that  Nick was beaten twice in one day by the police . Meanwhile ,  Samuel is lying in a hospital bed attached to a ventilator while  Catherine photographs  Samuel injuries . A doctor , Dr. Franks , tells  Catherine that since  Samuel is brain dead ,  Samuel \\'s hoping to contact  Samuel family and get permission to remove  Samuel from the ventilator and have  Samuel organs donated .  Samuel has suffered from blunt force trauma and has a piece of  Samuel skull embedded in  Samuel brain .  Catherine notices a shoe print on  Samuel \\'s face , which indicates that  Samuel was on the ground when  Samuel was attacked .    Lt . Arthur Chen tells Warrick and Vartann that the central holding can fit 25 prisoners ; however , on this day , there were 35 prisoners waiting to be processed . He insists that there were no prisoners from rival gangs and that there was a backup because of a computer problem .  Lt . Chen shows disdain for  suspects prisoners , comparing  suspects to monkeys at the zoo . The slur does not go unnoticed by  Warrick .  Warrick asks  Lt . Chen how the gun got past security and is told that there was a bad search by the officer .  Lt . Chen takes offense when  Warrick asks  Warrick whether  Warrick conducts another search when the prisoner is brought to  Warrick cell .  Warrick tells  Warrick that it \\'s sloppy police work and that , no matter what  Warrick thought of  suspects prisoners , one of  suspects is brain dead .  Lt . Chen refuses to answer to a crime scene tech , but  Warrick asks him for his armor , shields , boots , and baton .  Warrick brings Mia Dickerson the face shields , vests , and  batons collected from the prison and asks her to run  batons batons first , as  batons were the only weapons in the cell .   Later , at the hospital , Samuel \\'s father tells Catherine and Dr. Franks that the person lying in bed on the ventilator is not his son ; therefore , he can not consent to have his organs donated . Dr. Franks says that either Mr. Mendez ca n\\'t accept reality or the county made a mistake . In the lab ,  Catherine compares the prints taken in booking with  Samuel \\'s prints on file and sees that they do n\\'t match . Furthermore , another Samuel Mendez \\'s whereabouts are unknown , he has an active arrest warrant for murder , and he is considered armed and dangerous .   Mia Dickerson tells  Catherine that the batons that were tested came back positive for blood , epithelals and hair and that they contain several DNA sources from everyone except Samuel Mendez .  Catherine concludes that  Samuel was already beaten and lying on the ground when the police entered the holding cell . After  Catherine finishes with Mia ,  Catherine is stopped by  Lt . Chen in the hallway .  Catherine tells him that the investigation is still ongoing , but that it appears that the wrong Samuel Mendez was arrested . A flashback shows  Samuel being pulled over for a routine traffic stop and when  Samuel name was run , it came back with an outstanding warrant for murder .  Lt . Chen insists that he did his job correctly and  Catherine does n\\'t disagree ; however , he tells  Catherine that  Warrick seems to see things differently . He instructs  Catherine to make sure  Warrick gets in line before things get ugly .    Catherine summons  Warrick into  Catherine new office and tells  Warrick that  Lt . Chen stopped by to complain about  Warrick .  Warrick brings up Grissom \\'s name , to which  Catherine says that  Catherine \\'s not  Warrick and wo n\\'t let things slide .  Catherine tells  Warrick that the extraction team was cleared of  Samuel \\'s beating and that  Samuel owes Lt . Chen an apology . Meanwhile ,  Catherine processes the gun found under  Samuel \\'s body and extracts a hair and some skin from it . Elsewhere ,  Warrick tests the tread marks from  suspects prisoners \\' shoes and compares it to the mark on  Samuel \\'s face , while  Nick test fires the bullets from the gun and runs them through the database .  Catherine meets with  Nick and  Warrick and asks for their findings .  Warrick tells  Catherine that the shoe print on  Samuel \\'s face matched the boots worn by Vincent Mendoza , who was booked for meth manufacturing .  Catherine says that  Samuel \\'s cause of death was blunt force trauma and not stomping , but  Warrick guesses that same person could have done both .  Nick , meanwhile , found that the gun they uncovered was used in an execution - style murder .   Vincent Mendoza is brought into interrogation , where  Warrick and Det . Vartann that he is on the hook for two murders . Vincent denies this , but  Warrick tells him that he was a carrying a concealed weapon and tried to ditch it . A flashback shows Vincent trying to ditch the gun when  Samuel saw  Samuel do it . Vincent , irate that he got caught and thinking that a new prisoner would rat on him , rammed Samuel into a wall and stomped on his head . This caused the fight to break out and get the police involved .  Warrick and Det . Vartann also bring up the fact that Vincent \\'s partner was found dead in the desert a few weeks earlier and that the same gun was used in the homicide .  Samuel \\'s lawyer says that there is no proof that any of this happened until  Warrick tells her that Vincent \\'s pubic hair and feces were found caught in the gun \\'s hammer .']\n",
      "s04e12 ['Synopsis The double murder of a young nurse and her boyfriend makes  Grissom question  Grissom workaholic lifestyle . To make matters worse for  Grissom , the nurse bears a striking resemblance to Sara .   Plot Victim : Debbie Marlin ( deceased )   On the case : Catherine Willows , Gil Grissom , Sara Sidle , Warrick Brown , Jim Brass   As the episode opens ,  Grissom is already in the house of Debbie Marlin .  Grissom carefully makes  Grissom way through the house , hugging the walls as  Grissom goes .  Grissom notices many things in the house , including two empty wine glasses and a bottle of wine . As  Grissom makes  Grissom way down the hallway ,  Grissom sees brush strokes from a vacuum cleaner along with footprints leading to and from the bedroom .  Grissom eventually makes  Grissom way to the bathroom . There ,  Debbie \\'s body is found slouched over in the shower with a blood pool formed around  Debbie head .  Grissom looks closely at the victim and sees that  Debbie bears a striking resemblance to  Sara .  Grissom eventually works  Grissom way back outside , where officers and  Grissom  CSI team are waiting for  Grissom .  Grissom tells everyone that  CSI CSI can enter the house .    Grissom hands  everyone  everyone assignments - Warrick will process the two vehicles in the driveway ( one belongs to the friend who found  Debbie \\'s body ) ,  Sara will process the perimeter of the house , and  Catherine will talk to  Debbie \\'s friend , then process the crime scene with  Grissom .    Catherine speaks to  Debbie \\'s friend , Kelly McNeil .  Kelly tells  Catherine that  Catherine and Debbie are both nurses at Desert Palm Hospital . They had made lunch plans the day before , but  Debbie had canceled in order to spend time with  Debbie new boyfriend Michael Clark , a surgical intern at the hospital .  Kelly had called  Debbie multiple times and gotten no response .  Kelly entered the house using the key  Debbie gave  Kelly , saw the body , and ran out .  Kelly also tells  Catherine that  Kelly does n\\'t recall seeing Michael at the hospital that day .    Sara examines the side of the house and finds a white , powdery film covering the concrete . Across the street ,  Brass questions Jeff Pike , who had been seen earlier chatting it up loudly with his neighbors .  Jeff tells  Brass that  Jeff \\'s running for captain of the neighborhood watch and knows a lot of things about a lot of people on the street .  Jeff says that  Debbie was an attractive single girl who constantly got visits from male doctors and other male medical personnel .  Brass asks  Jeff if  Jeff remembers any specific vehicles parked at  Debbie \\'s , and  Jeff remembers seeing a 2004 black Mercedes E320 for the last month .   After not finding much around the perimeter of the house ,  Sara meets up with  Warrick .  Jeff tells  Sara that the backseat of  Debbie \\'s unlocked car was filled with groceries , leading  Sara to wonder if  Debbie was interrupted after returning home from shopping . Inside the house ,  Grissom is crouched next to  Debbie \\'s body as  Catherine walks in .  Grissom says that  Grissom smells something , and  Catherine believes it \\'s some kind of bleach or cleanser .  Catherine looks at the arterial spray patterns on the shower door and walls and concludes that  Debbie was standing up when  Catherine was attacked .  Catherine remarks that despite all the blood present , there are no signs of bloody hand prints or footprints left behind by the killer .  Grissom becomes fixated on the unusual position of the body , thinking that  Debbie was staged this way .    Sara and  Warrick enter the house and look through the refrigerator . There are some groceries that  Debbie was able to get into the house ; however ,  Sara can not find a receipt . Based on the expiration date on the milk , they conclude that  Debbie visited the supermarket two days ago , which is also the last time Michael \\'s car was seen in front of the house .    Catherine and  Grissom continue to process the bathroom , where they find evidence of blood and bleach in all four drains . They guess that the killer murdered Debbie , then washed up in both sinks and the bathtub . When asked why ,  Grissom says that the answer is in the pipes .  Sara is sent under the house to collect evidence from the pipes and collects red - stained water that ties to the shower drain . Back in the bathroom ,  Catherine and  Grissom spray luminol all around the bathroom . It becomes clear that the killer wiped away the blood and cleaned everything with bleach ; the only place he left blood was in the shower next to  Debbie \\'s body .  Catherine remarks that they are going to have a hard time finding out where the blood ends and the bleach begins , while  Grissom wonders where all the blood is coming from .    Brass goes to Desert Palm Hospital and speaks to Dr. Vincent Lurie , who tells Brass that Michael Clark is on his surgical rotation . However , Michael did not show up that morning . According to Dr. Lurie , Michael is a gifted surgeon who also has an active social life that he does n\\'t let interfere with his work . Meanwhile , back in  Debbie \\'s house ,  Catherine notes that there are no cleansers , rags , sponges or paper towels present .  Warrick finds this odd , as  Debbie had clearly been shopping recently .  Catherine figures that the killer used up all of the supplies , while  Grissom sees that the wastebasket is empty and guesses that the killer disposed of everything . Catherine ,  Grissom and  Warrick head outside the house and into the alleyway where there are a bunch of trash bins lined up on both sides of the road . After coming up empty on the first few bins ,  Grissom notices flies buzzing around another bin . When  Grissom opens it ,  Grissom finds an empty bottle of bleach , bloody towels , and a plastic bag with flesh in it .  Grissom figures that there has to be more bags like that in the other bins .   The following day ,  Catherine ,  Grissom and  Warrick go through the trash bins and finds several bags containing flesh and organs from a male victim .  Grissom also finds a filled vacuum bag , indicating that the killer cleaned up any evidence of themselves in the house . In the lab ,  Sara filters the water  Sara collected from the pipe and finds  hairs from multiple donors ; however ,  hairs are unusable thanks to the bleach .  Sara looks in the pipe and finds a hair that the bleach missed ; luckily , this hair has a skin tag on it .   In the morgue , David Phillips is piecing the dismembered body together one one of the tables . On the other table ,  Catherine is looking over  Debbie \\'s body with Doc Robbins , who tells  Catherine that  Debbie died at least 24 hours ago .  Debbie cause of death a deep incised wound on the neck that transected both carotid arteries and the anterior trachea . Doc Robbins tells  Catherine that the instrument that caused this was short and extremely short ; they both guess that the killer used a scalpel . The doc notes that the killer had to have spent at least 12 hours dismembering the other body . The patella had been cleanly removed from the body and the femur was separated from the tibia and fibula . Based on the fact that the killer knew this much about human anatomy and that the tool used may have been a scalpel ,  Catherine thinks they are looking for a doctor .    Grissom is in  Debbie \\'s room looking at one of  Catherine butterfly trinkets , which seems to match most of the room .  Grissom looks in the mirror and pictures  Debbie sitting on  Catherine bed ;  Debbie then transforms into  Sara . A phone call from  Sara interrupts his train of thought .  Sara tells him  Sara got a skin tag from a hair in the drain , but  Grissom pretends to have bad reception and ends the call early to go back to being alone with  Grissom thoughts .    Sara hangs up with  Grissom and meets up with  Warrick in the CSI garage . Michael Clark \\'s black Mercedes has been brought in after being found in the long - term parking lot at the airport .  They figure Michael killed two people and skipped town , with  Warrick noting that the best way to get a car stolen is to leave it unlocked at the airport . With nothing visible ,  They decide to fume the car .  They find that everything except the driver \\'s seat has been wiped down , just like in  Debbie \\'s house .  Warrick finds a piece of a black trash bag wedged in the track of the driver \\'s seat ; a flashback shows the driver adjust the seat and getting the bag stuck in the track . They note that Michael was 5\\'9 \" , but when  Warrick gets in the driver \\'s seat ,  Warrick sees that it is adjusted for someone even taller than  Warrick ( 6\\'2 \" ) .   Catherine ,  Sara and  Warrick are sitting around the conference table with  Grissom on the speaker phone from  Debbie \\'s house . They recap the case -  Debbie came home from the grocery store , parked in the driveway , and unloaded  Debbie perishable items first , leaving the front door open . This explains why there was no forced entry .  Debbie got ready for  Debbie date , lighting candles everywhere and preparing the bottle of wine with two glasses .  Greg interrupts and says that the hairs  Sara found in the drain belong to Michael Clark . There were also no fingerprints found on the scalpel or any other instruments used in the killings .  Grissom continues - as Debbie lit the candles in the shower ,  Debbie was attacked from behind and  Debbie throat was slit . The body was positioned in a way so that it was the first thing Michael saw when he entered the bathroom . Michael was then killed and dismembered in the bathtub .  Catherine wonders why  Debbie \\'s murder was quick , but the killer took the time to dismember Michael .  Grissom guesses that Michael was the real target of the killer \\'s rage .    Warrick empties the vacuum bag that was found earlier and separates everything out .  Sara enters , and  Warrick tells  Sara that  Warrick found white carpet fibers in the bag , and only the spare bedroom in  Debbie \\'s house has a white carpet .  Warrick also found a butterfly charm , which  Warrick guesses could have come off a bracelet in a struggle .  Sara surmises that the killer was in the spare bedroom at some point , even though the room was n\\'t on the killer \\'s entrance or exit path .    Grissom is still in  Debbie \\'s house , testing the hallway carpet for blood .  Catherine enters and notes that  Grissom is on  Grissom third shift ;  Grissom replies that  Grissom \\'s only getting started , as  Grissom has yet to check the other rooms for blood .  Grissom also admits that  Grissom has n\\'t eaten anything . After doing so ,  Grissom tells  Catherine that  Grissom does n\\'t want to leave until  Grissom finds some evidence . They recap the case again , with  Catherine saying that  Debbie was \" sexing  Debbie up \" for Michael \\'s arrival . They decide to process the bedroom . No evidence is found on the sheets , but both  Catherine and  Grissom find red silk scarves tied to the mattress . They were used to tie  Debbie to the bed during sex , and  Catherine notes that Michael probably used the bed frame as leverage and dusts it for prints .  Warrick calls  Grissom and tells  Warrick about the butterfly charm  Warrick found in the vacuum bag .  Grissom heads to the spare bedroom . After looking over all of the butterfly trinkets on the dresser ,  Grissom opens a jewelry box and finds a pendant that says \" Love , Dr. T \" on it .  Grissom also finds another broken butterfly charm .  Catherine enters and tells  Grissom that  Catherine was able to recover a toe print from the bed frame and that  Catherine \\'ll have  Sara compare it to the victims .  Grissom is pleased with this information , and  Grissom tells  Catherine about the butterfly charm and wonders if the killer was trying to take his gift back . He also finds a strand of hair on the shelf and tells  Catherine that this is why he never left the scene .   In the morgue ,  Sara takes toe print samples from  Debbie . It is only now that  Sara realizes the facial similarities between  Sara and the victim .  Sara finds  Catherine and asks where  Grissom is ;  Catherine replies that  Grissom is still at the crime scene .  Sara tells  Sara that the toe prints recovered from the bed frame do not match either victim .  Catherine notes the similarities between  Sara and Debbie , but a visibly shaken  Sara says that she did n\\'t notice .   In the hospital ,  Catherine takes the footprints of all male doctors . Dr. Howard Tripton states that there were probably a little bit of everyone in  Debbie \\'s house . Dr. Lurie tells  Brass that there is a code of honor among  doctors , and that a lot of  doctors are married and would n\\'t want this information getting out . Jacqui Franco is able to positively match the toe print from the bed frame to Dr. Tripton .    Catherine and Brass interrogate Howard , who says that he gave  Debbie a ride home one night while  Debbie car was in the shop .  Debbie did n\\'t want  people wearing shoes in  Debbie house , so he took  people off . He tells  Catherine and Brass that  Debbie was provocative and that  Debbie came on to him .  Brass mentions that Michael Clark was on  Howard \\'s surgical rotation the day he was killed . When  Howard called in sick , it freed Michael up to be with Debbie , who was also off of work .  Howard replies that  Howard kids had events  Howard had to take them to and that the surgery  Howard was supposed to perform was elective .  Catherine shows  Howard the jewelry , and  Howard positively identifies the bracelet  Howard gave to  Debbie .   The hair  Grissom found in the spare bedroom is put under the microscope .  Greg tells  Greg that the oily substance on it is propylene glycol - an active ingredient in Rogaine for male pattern baldness .  Greg tells  Greg that the hair also tested positive for Propecia .  Grissom runs into Catherine , who tells  Greg that  Brass let  Howard walk after  Howard used sex as  Greg alibi .  Greg asks  her about  Howard \\'s hair ;  her tells  Greg  Howard is neither going bald nor has graying hair .  Catherine also says that  Howard is left - handed .   Doc Robbins calls  Grissom down to the morgue . With the dismembered body laid out , the doc says that Michael Clark was probably laying face up when he was killed . The killer is probably left - handed due to the angle of the cuts on the right femur . Doc Robbins says that this information wo n\\'t be admissible in court , but  Grissom says  Grissom does n\\'t care about court .  Grissom \\'s only looking for a left - handed , Propecia - using surgeon who is probably on staff at Desert Palm Hospital .   In the hospital , the doctors who fit the description are put in a row .  Greg uses the ALS on their heads and eventually finds a match in Dr. Vincent Lurie . Back in the police department interrogation room ,  Grissom and  Brass talk to  Vincent . The doctor admits to taking Rogaine and Propecia and also identifies the bracelet he gave to  Debbie . They have no other evidence against  Vincent and Brass offers up  Vincent theory -  Vincent killed  Debbie because  Vincent rejected  Vincent and Michael Clark paid the price .  Vincent \\'s lawyer says that  both do n\\'t have a case and  both start to walk out of the room .    Grissom then gives  Grissom two cents -  Grissom and  Vincent are not that much different .  Both are middle - aged men consumed by work who only get to touch people while wearing latex gloves .  Both realize  Both have n\\'t lived much of a life , until  Both are given a second chance when a young , beautiful woman enters it .  Grissom says  Grissom could n\\'t risk  Grissom career to be with the woman , but  Vincent did .  Debbie showed  Vincent a wonderful life , then took  it away from  Grissom and gave  it to someone else . In response ,  Vincent took  Vincent life . A flashback shows  Vincent killing  Debbie , then ripping apart the butterfly bracelet  Vincent gave  Debbie . When Michael entered , he killed him as well .    Grissom tells  Vincent that  Grissom now has nothing , but  Vincent replies that  Vincent \\'s still here . \" Are you ? \" asks  Grissom .  Vincent walks out of the room a free man . Meanwhile ,  Sara has been watching this whole exchange from behind the two - way glass .']\n",

Elsewhere ,  Greg stops  Grissom and wants to know if  Greg 'll be able to work in the field permanently at some point ;  Grissom tells  Greg that  Greg can after  Greg trains a replacement .  Greg hands  Grissom test results ; the DNA collected off of  Catherine matches a rape - murder case from a year ago .   Warrick and  Grissom go over the previous case - the rape and murder victim was 32-year old Emma Dobbins , who was found not far from where  Catherine was assaulted . Emma and Linley are both white and of similar ages ; however , the physical connections stop there . A size nine shoe print was found at both scenes , and the immediate guess is that they were raped by the same person .   The sketch artist finishes her sketch with  Catherine 's help . Using the facial composite and license plate information , Dr. Todd Coombs is identified as a suspect and brought in by  Brass for questioning .  Catherine notices a scratch on the front of  Todd 's car , which lines up with  Catherine 's story that  Catherine car was hit from behind . At the station ,  Catherine picks  Todd out of a police lineup and  Grissom collects a DNA sample from  Todd . Comparisons of  Todd 's shoes and DNA to evidence from the crime scenes of both Linley Parker and Emma Dobbins results in no matches , however , the seminal DNA indicates that the rapist is possibly  Todd 's brother .  Todd is released from custody and  Catherine informs Linley , who remains sure of  Catherine lineup identification and fears retribution from  Todd . Sara workups a family tree for  Todd and the CSIs speak with three of  Todd brothers , collecting DNA from all of them . The fourth brother , Kevin Coombs , can not be found .   While at the lab ,  Catherine receives an urgent call from  Catherine that ends abruptly with sounds of a struggle and screams .  Catherine car is found abandoned on Fremont Street with the window smashed ; a piece of the broken window has some blood on it , which is likely from the attacker . Grissom notes that  Catherine was on the phone with  Linley when  Linley was attacked ; however , there is no sign of a cell phone in the car . The whereabouts of three  Coombs brothers are confirmed , but  Coombs Coombs is said by  Coombs wife to be at  Coombs house company .  Brass happens to drive by  Coombs as  Coombs 's vacuuming  Coombs car at a car wash and speaks to  Coombs briefly , but can not search  Coombs vehicle without a warrant . After  Todd leaves ,  Brass radios the lab , as  Coombs wants someone to retrieve everything that  Todd vacuumed up . CSIs track the GPS on  Linley 's phone to an empty lot on the edge of town in a jacket taken by a feral dog .  Coombs corpse is found in the same lot .   In autopsy ,  Catherine takes photos of  Linley 's body and tape lifts the body for evidence ;  Catherine finds something that looks like a hair .  Sara and Det .  Vartann walk the property where  Linley 's body was discovered ;  Sara notes that the property belongs to the Coombs family . They find the fifth brother , Kevin Coombs , at his trailer home . He answers the door with a shotgun and is taken into custody . Back in autopsy , Doc Robbins tells  Grissom that  Linley 's cause of death was asphyxia due to strangulation . He also says that  Linley was raped again ;  Linley does have defensive wounds on  Linley , indicating that  Linley fought back . Meanwhile , at  Kevin's 's ,  Sara finds a rusted Pontiac amongst old cars and car parts and remembers that the first victim , Emma Dobbins , owned the same car .  Sara photographs the VIN number .   Det .  Vartann interrogates Kevin , who is largely uncooperative . However , he does provide the knowledge that the government can watch you whenever and wherever they want after they have a sample of your DNA .  Grissom meets  Todd outside of the interrogation room , and  Todd tells  Todd that  Todd 's the only one in the family that understands  Kevin's .  Todd maintains that  Kevin's is harmless and that  Kevin's chooses to live off the grid and turn car wrecks taken from this brothers ' garage into art .  Grissom informs  Todd that the VIN number from the Pontiac found in  Kevin's 's yard belongs to a victim that was raped and killed by the same person who did the same to  Linley . Additionally ,  Linley 's body was found on  Kevin's 's property .  Todd simply replies that the CSIs have been wrong before .    Nick goes through the contents of the vacuum from the car wash and finds a label from a potted plant purchased at the house company , confirming  Todd 's alibi .  Warrick walks in to assist and finds a lapel pin from the Palms casino amongst the contents .  Nick says that a lot of people work on the Palms and that this does n't necessarily connect  Todd to the crime .    Catherine and  Grissom look over  Linley 's crime scene photos and  Grissom tells  Catherine that the blood recovered from  Linley 's smashed car window is a match to the semen from all of the rapes . This means that the DNA does n't match  Todd or any of  Todd brothers . Greg interrupts and tells them that the hair  Catherine lifted from  Linley 's body is a match to  Todd .  Grissom is unsure that  Todd is the guy since the evidence never lies , but  Catherine is all set to  Brass  Brass and have  Grissom bring  Todd back to the station .    Todd is brought back in for processing .  Grissom has  Grissom strip down to  Grissom underwear so  Grissom can take photos and document any injuries .  Todd explains that bruises on  Todd wrists are from moving boxes .  Grissom then notices a scar on  Todd 's lower back ;  Todd says that  Grissom was a bone marrow donor when  Grissom brother had leukemia . When  Grissom takes a photo of the scar , a flash reveals a patter on  Todd 's back .  Grissom takes another photo and sees the same thing .  Grissom has an officer turn off the lights and retrieves  Grissom ALS ;  Grissom sees that  Todd has V - shaped patterns up and down  Grissom back .    Grissom does some research and discovers that has a condition called Tetragametic chimerism , in which the embryos of fraternal twins collapse into one . As  Grissom goes through various photos of  Todd 's home office ,  Grissom finds one that contains a chimera statuette .  Grissom collects a blood sample from  Todd in  Grissom holding cell . After  Grissom reveals that  Grissom knows  Todd 's bone marrow donation to  Grissom brother failed ,  Todd acknowledges that  Todd 's aware of  Todd condition :  Todd has two completely different sets of DNA in  Todd body . In the interrogation room ,  Todd admits  Todd guilt to  Brass while being video recorded .  Todd claims that there are more than two victims , but this is never expounded on .   At the end of shift , Nick , Sara and Warrick are seen walking down the strip .  Warrick invites them to a meal , but they turn  Warrick down .  Sara congratulates  Nick on  Warrick almost - promotion , telling  Warrick  Warrick deserves it .  Nick asks  Sara if it was hard for  Sara to say , and  Sara agrees that it was . Later ,  Grissom receives a call in  Grissom office . An officer discloses that  Sara has been pulled over for a DUI . While  Sara blood alcohol content is technically over the legal limit , the limit had been lowered recently and the officer cuts  Sara a break by not booking  Sara .  Grissom arrives , holds a despondent  Sara 's hands , and tells  Sara that  Grissom 'll take  Sara home .\"]\n",
      "s03e21 ['Synopsis Grissom ,  Catherine and Nick investigate when a horse trainer is found dead in the cargo bay of a private jet . At first it looks like the victim is trampled by the horse , but  Grissom and  Grissom team soon discover the situation is more complex . Meanwhile , Warrick and Sara investigate how two teens could have committed suicide in the middle of the desert .   Plot Victim : Lori Hutchins ( deceased )   On the case : Catherine Willows , Gil Grissom , Nick Stokes , Jim Brass   On a fancy private jet , a group of people are partying and drinking . The plane goes through turbulence forcing  everyone to sit down and put  everyone seat belts on . A deck below in the cargo hold , a horse is in it \\'s private stable with a woman dead at its feet .    Catherine and  Grissom meets Brass in the airplane hangar , where he tells them that the victim \\'s name is Lori Hutchins . Lori , the horse \\'s trainer , had chaperoned the horse on airplane trips all the time ;  Catherine body was found after the passengers had disembarked .  Grissom says that they \\'re going to need to process everyone that was on the plane , starting with the first witness and suspect - the horse .    Catherine speaks to the flight crew who says that  Lori was a polite , quiet woman who always traveled with the horse . One of the crew checked in on  Catherine and the horse twice , and dinner had been brought to  Lori three hours into the flight . The crew mentions the turbulence to  Catherine and tells  Catherine that there was an emergency button down where  Lori was , but  Lori never used it .   In the stable ,  Grissom photographs blood and finds a pair of scissors with blood on them buried in the hay .  Grissom also finds a tranquilizer gun and several tranquilizer darts buried . In the cargo hold ,  Catherine finds brown shavings on the ground and another tranquilizer dart embedded in the ceiling . A flashback shows the horse acting wildly during the turbulence and  Lori trying to sedate it . When  Lori missed with the shot ,  Lori fell and the horse trampled  Lori .  Nick enters and notes that someone stepped in horse poop , leaving behind a well - defined shoe print .  Catherine notices the print as being from a high - grade driving loafer .   On the plane where most of the passengers were , Brass tells  Catherine that there 12 people on board with no assigned seating . Apparently ,  they could do whatever  they wanted .  Catherine and  Nick spot a bed in the corner with several semen stains on it , as well as a used condon . There are also bloody paper towels in a nearby waste basket .    Catherine and Grissom enter the airplane hangar where the veterinarian , Dr. Stevens , is tending to the horse . A woman is outside talking to the police and demanding to see her horse ; she walks away in a huff when she is denied . Dr. Stevens tells Catherine and Grissom that the horse is still spooked , as horses do not adapt to change well . Losing her trainer is also having an effect . With the doctor \\'s help , they are able to process the horse and find some evidence . Dr. Stevens tells Grissom that the horse is prone to serious uterine infections , which is why the horse is stapled up . The doctor also pulls something from between the horse \\'s teeth .  Catherine asks for a blood sample from the horse and tells Dr. Stevens that they found a tranquilizer gun . He tells  Catherine that you do n\\'t use tranquilizer guns on horses , as the impact energy would cause an immediate adrenaline response and make the horse more agitated .   In the lab ,  Catherine is testing the brown shavings  Catherine found earlier .  Nick enters and tells  Catherine that all of the shoes were collected from the passengers .  Catherine was right - the shoe print belonged to a loafer and it had horse poop in the treads . The suspect , Harper Fitzgerald , is brought into the station .   In the morgue , Doc Robbins tells  Grissom that  Lori had peri - mortem bruising and scarring , both minor and major . They are all consistent with being trampled , except that  Lori has tiny pupils , indicating an opioid overdose .  Lori overdosed on the tranquilizer and has an puncture wound in one of  Lori bruises the size of the tranquilizer dart .  Grissom notes that one ca n\\'t shoot themselves in the shoulder with a tranquilizer rifle , meaning someone else shot  Lori and pinned the death on the horse .   In the interrogation room ,  Nick tells  Harper that  Lori shoe print was found was found in the cargo hold where  Lori \\'s body was found .  Harper tells them that  Lori owns the plane and can go wherever  Lori wants .  Lori admits to being down in the cargo hold trying to buy the horse , but that  Lori is no use to  Lori dead .  Nick takes a DNA sample from  Lori .    Grissom informs  Catherine that the tranquilizer gun has been wiped clean and that there were no prints on the dart  Lori found in the cargo hold \\'s ceiling . There is a partial palm print in the dart in the container , but not enough for a comparison . However ,  Grissom tells  Catherine that there three different matches for prints on the railing leading down to the cargo hold - Harper Fitzgerald ( owner of the plane ) , Jason Banks ( the steward who brought  Lori  Catherine dinner ) , and Rhone Confer ( formerly a concierge at the Orpheous hotel ) .  Catherine says that this is interesting , as the brown shavings found earlier in the cargo hold and the horse \\'s teeth came back as  tobacco .  tobacco tobacco is from a  Cuban cigar , and  Catherine notes that if you want to find where to buy a  Cuban cigar , you ask a concierge .   In interrogation ,  Catherine and Brass question Rhone Confer .  He says  He was on the plane because  He was friendly with  Harper .  Catherine mentions Cuban cigars , which  Rhone says should be legal .  He claims  He never went near Lori Hutchins , but  Catherine tells  He  He print was found on the railing .  Rhone admits to planning a party a year before for  Harper and  Rhone hit  Rhone off .  He started getting invited to parties , and this was  He first time on the jet . Despite being told not to go down to the cargo hold ,  He went down anyway .  He got too close to the horse , which started chewing on  He cigar .  Rhone saw Lori \\'s body and fled the scene , keeping  He mouth shut .  He claims  He did n\\'t want to be a buzzkill and get  He kicked out of  Harper \\'s inner circle .  Catherine gets a sample of  He DNA .   Greg tells  Catherine that the blood on the paper towels belonged to  Lori . However , there were two donors on another part of the towel - one belonging to  Lori and the other to an unknown source . The other source did not match the DNA of  Harper or  Rhone ; more suspects need to be rounded up .  Catherine then gets a call .  Catherine and  Grissom head back out to the airplane hangar , where Dr. Stevens tells them that he tried to save the horse , but the horse died from uterine infections .  Grissom tells him that  Grissom found suture scissors near Lori \\'s body on the plane and asks the doctor if it \\'s possible  Lori tried to relieve the horse \\'s infection on the plane . Dr. Stevens tells him that it would have to be critical for  Lori to try emergency surgery in the air .   An autopsy is performed on the horse and a pouch is found inside the animal \\'s uterus .  Grissom cuts open the bag and pours it out to reveal uncut diamonds . In Dr. Stevens \\' office ,  Grissom tells  Catherine that , according to the receptionist , Dr. Stevens left town unexpectedly .  Catherine finds diamond dust on the table and a lot of red lentils , which are supposed to prevent diamonds from chipping .  Grissom tells  Catherine that a horse \\'s uterus is the size of a football , meaning there could have been a lot more diamonds inside of the horse .  Grissom guesses that Dr. Stevens left one bag behind because  Grissom could n\\'t reach it . However , the doctor was n\\'t on the plane , so he could n\\'t be guilty of murder . He must have had a partner .   In the lab ,  Catherine performs some measurements and deduces that  they are looking for approximately four more pouches of  diamonds .  Grissom runs tests on  diamonds diamonds and the results show that  they are coming from central or south Africa .  Catherine believes  they are conflict diamonds that finance warlords and support child slavery .  they are banned by the United Nations , which is why  they had to be smuggled into the country . Additionally , by bypassing customs , the smuggler would n\\'t have to pay a tax on  diamonds diamonds .  Catherine surmises that  Lori may have been killed because  Catherine discovered what  Catherine horse was being used for .    Brass interviews Jason Banks , the steward . He is the only person on the plane whose passport was stamped in Sierra Leone .  Jason claims  Jason traveled the world because the Fitzgeralds wanted  Jason to pick  things up for  things .  Jason compares it to being a messenger boy .  Jason claims  Jason would usually pick up art or antiques and that the packages would be wrapped up .  Brass informs  Jason that  Brass was the other contributor on the bloody paper towels found in the waste basket on the plane .  Brass replies that when  Brass brought  Lori  Lori dinner ,  Lori handed  Jason the bloody towels , as the horse had been acting up .  Brass does n\\'t seem to believe  Jason \\'s story .    Grissom tells  Catherine that  Grissom found traces of carrots on the diamonds , meaning that  Lori probably packed the diamonds  Lori after feeding the horse .  Catherine surmises that Dr. Stevens did n\\'t have one partner ,  Grissom had two .  Lori was the only one who knew that there were five packages of diamonds ; Dr. Stevens purposely left one behind to incriminate  Lori .   In the A / V lab ,  Grissom notes that the diamonds are worthless if you do n\\'t have a buyer .  Nick wonders if Dr. Stevens smuggled the diamonds to the Cayman Islands , but  Catherine asks why someone would go to all the trouble to smuggle the diamonds into the country , then smuggle them out .  Grissom says that  Jason \\'s story checks out ;  Lori had a ante - mortem gash on  Lori forearm . When Rhone Confer \\'s name comes up on the screen , it comes up as Rhone Kinsey - Confer .  Catherine recognizes the name \" Kinsey , \" and says  Catherine \\'s going to find out what Rhone \\'s mother \\'s maiden name was .  Catherine tells Grissom and  Nick that  Catherine bought  Catherine engagement ring from Kinsey Diamonds . Brass and the police raid the jewelry store and seize all of the diamonds . When  Catherine Kinsey objects ,  Brass tells  Catherine to think - did  Catherine son really mine the diamonds himself ?   In the interrogation room ,  Grissom and Brass interview  Rhone . They tell him that he had a good plan , but he got caught . Brass guesses that  Lori \\'s death was an accident and  Grissom wonders if  Lori cared more about the horse than the diamonds . They use a warrant to get  Rhone to remove his shirt , and he reveals a large black and blue bruise on his chest .  Grissom notes that high - powered pneumatic guns do n\\'t need to be loaded to leave a mark .   In a flashback , the horse is acting erratically while  Lori and  Rhone argue .  Lori tells him  Lori \\'s going to take the diamonds out against  Rhone \\'s wishes . He points the gun at  Lori and they struggle , with one tranquilizer dart ending up in the ceiling .  Lori wrestles the gun away and fires it into  Rhone \\'s chest , leaving the mark .  Rhone grabbed a tranquilizer dart and stuck in  Lori \\'s arm . As  Lori collapsed to the ground , the frightened horse trampled  Lori to death . Confronted with the evidence ,  Rhone calls  Lori a \" freakin \\' pony lover . \"   Victims : Toby Wellstone ( deceased ) , Jill Frommer ( deceased )   On the case :  Sara Sidle , Warrick Brown , Cyrus Lockwood   In Death Valley , a body of a young man is found on a blanket \" coffin ready , \" wearing a black suit and laying flat on  Sara back with arms crossed over  Sara chest .  Sara notices a white patch on the blanket and thinks it might be bird poop .  Warrick finds the victim \\'s wallet , revealing the man to be Toby Wellstone , a student at McKinley High School . On  Toby \\'s left hand is a transdermal patch containing fentanyl , allowing it to be absorbed through the skin and into the bloodstream . It appears to be an intentional overdose .  Sara wonders how the victim got this far out into the desert with no mode of transportation in sight .  Warrick sees some tire treads that  Sara photographs .    Warrick informs  Sara that  Toby did n\\'t have any parents and that  Warrick had been through seven foster homes in seven years .  Sara says that the high school told  Sara  Toby was out of school more than  Toby was in it . Doc Robbins tells them that  Toby \\'s last meal was a hamburger , fries , and shake . He also added fentanyl in patch and pill form .  Sara notes that there is cisapride on the toxicology report , and Doc Robbins tells  Sara that this is an agent that speeds up the body \\'s absorption of fentanyl and it keeps the stomach acids from going into reflux . With no vomiting , there is no chance for survival . There are two scars on  Toby \\'s right wrist , indicating that  Toby had tried to kill  Toby twice before .   Later on ,  Sara and  Warrick meet Det . Lockwood back out in the desert where another body has been found . This time , the victim is a teenage girl wearing a black prom dress . There is no scarring on the victim \\'s wrist , but she is wearing the same transdermal patch that  Toby was wearing . There is also a white mark on the victim \\'s body , which  Sara believes could have been transferred from  Toby \\'s blanket . They may be looking at a Romeo and Juliet scenario .  Sara believes that something is off , however , as the victim \\'s dress is too big for  Sara .    Sara processes the dress and comes to the conclusion that  Sara girl made  Sara own dress , but did n\\'t know  Sara own measurements .  Warrick tells  Sara that the sexual assault kit on  Sara girl came back negative . However ,  Sara girl \\'s stomach contents were the same as  Toby \\'s , even down to the same dosages of fentanyl and cisapride .  Warrick finds it weird that  Sara girl \\'s fingerprints were on  Toby \\'s fentanyl patch and  Toby \\'s were on hers .  Sara wonders why did n\\'t find any trash at the crime scenes or any suicide notes .  They also question why , if this was a suicide pact ,  Sara girl \\'s body was found far away from  Toby \\'s . Det . Lockwood interrupts  They and says that  Sara girl has been identified as Jill Frommer and that  Sara mother is coming in to identify the body .    Sara and Det . Lockwood talk to Mrs. Frommer , who says she does not recognize the dress  Jill was found in . Mrs. Frommer rebuffs the idea that  Jill sewed her own dress , as she was n\\'t that domesticated . It is revealed that Mrs. Frommer was foster parent to  Toby for a year before she sent  Toby back . Jill \\'s father had died and she could n\\'t handle  Toby on her own as  Toby was too much work . She took  Toby back in when  Jill showed her that  Toby was being abused at another foster house . Mrs. Frommer ignores the question as to whether  Jill and  Toby were romantically involved and she tells  Sara that she does n\\'t think  Jill had ever attempted suicide before . However , with  Toby around , she \\'s not so sure . Mrs. Frommer had called social services to rid herself of  Toby , but she claims that nobody wants to adopt teenagers , just children .  Sara believes the kids had help , but when  Sara asks Mrs. Frommer for the names of  Sara \\'s friends , Mrs. Frommer laughs and says that her daughter \\'s life was way out of her hands .    Sara and  Warrick interview three shallow teenage girls at the high school who tell the CSIs that  Jill had n\\'t attended school all year . When  Sara shows them a picture of the dress , they recognize it as belonging to Alyssa Jameson , who had worn the dress to homecoming the year before . According to the girls , Alyssa is a goody two shoes who spends her time saving the planet or helping the sick at the hospital .    Sara and  Warrick visit Alyssa at the hospital and  Sara confirms that  Sara gave  Sara dress to  Jill . When asked if  Sara gave  Jill fentanyl and cisapride , Alyssa immediately knows that  Jill killed  Jill .  Jill had also given Alyssa a necklace ; according to her , giving away prized possessions means someone is going to commit suicide . Alyssa admits trading the dress to  Jill for the necklace , as  Jill had told her she had a special occasion to wear the dress to . Alyssa said  Jill had been depressed , but she was hoping she was turning the corner .  Sara again asks if  Sara provided the drugs to  Jill or allowed  Sara access to them , but Alyssa points to a security camera and says that she could n\\'t even if she wanted to , which she did n\\'t .    Greg informs  Sara and Warrick that the hospital had n\\'t dispensed cisapride in over three years . Interestingly ,  Greg tells them that white substance found on the blanket and  Jill \\'s dress came back as baby spittle . The DNA from the spittle came back to  Toby and Jill - it was their baby in the desert . While the police comb the desert for signs of the baby , Sara , Warrick , and Det . Lockwood visit Mrs. Frommer \\'s house . Her credit card bill shows a purchase for a young man \\'s suit . They enter the house with a search warrant .  Warrick finds some greeting cards in a drawer . In the kitchen , Mrs. Frommer nervously looks on as  Sara and  Warrick search the cabinets .  Sara finds a bunch of pill bottles , as well as fentanyl and cisapride . Mrs. Frommer responds that her husband had gone through chemotherapy , while the fentanyl is for her back pain . When asked why she did n\\'t tell authorities that  Toby and  Jill had access to these medications , Mrs. Frommer simply replies that nobody asked .   Just then , they hear crying coming from the refrigerator .  Warrick opens the refrigerator door to reveal a baby monitor . They locate the baby in another part of the house ; Mrs. Frommer replies that she \\'s the baby \\'s only chance . When  Sara challenges this , Mrs. Frommer replies that it \\'s not against the law in Nevada to watch  people kill  people . A flashback shows  Sara admonishing  Toby and  Jill for ruining  Sara life .  Sara drove the kids out to Death Valley then took the baby with  Sara as they committed suicide . The tire tracks found earlier were from a baby carriage .  Jill had a change of heart and tried following  Jill mother , which is why  Jill was found in a separate location than  Toby . Mrs. Frommer tells the CSIs that the kids were beyond help .    Sara believes that they can convince a jury that Mrs. Frommer did more than just watch the suicides .  Sara replies that not helping a child in danger is a misdemeanor .  Sara threatens to write Mrs. Frommer up for murder and call Child Services on her , but Mrs. Frommer confidently replies that she is next of kin and has no criminal record . She is sure she will get the baby back .  Sara asks  Warrick if they stand a chance at making the charges stick , and  Warrick tells  Sara no .']\n",

He then talks to  Brenda , the younger sister , but  Brenda does not say anything until Grissom asks if anyone went into  Brenda room .  Brenda quietly answers , \" the buffalo \" , but does not say anything else . Grissom notes that a knife - presumably the murder weapon - is missing from the knife drawer . The CSIs discuss a possible sequence of events , speculating that the mother was killed first in her sleep and the father ran to protect his children , but was killed on the way to their rooms . Brass and Grissom question  Tina and learn that  Tina has no boyfriend and does not know anyone called “ Buffalo ” . Grissom processes  Tina ’s clothing and finds no blood on them .    Brenda is assigned to take care of Brenda , who shows signs of emotional shock and trauma .

Although  Brenda thinks that  Brenda is not good with children ,  Brenda attaches  Brenda to  Brenda . Outside , Nick and Warrick find a bidi and a match . They also find tire impressions which match a scooter owned by a boy in the neighborhood . He says that he does not know where his scooter is because he shares it with a few other boys and one of them has it .   Catherine and Grissom question  Tina and remind  Tina that  Tina said  Tina hugged  Tina mother \\'s body and tripped over  Tina father \\'s .  Tina can not explain why there is no blood on  Tina pajamas . The boys who share the scooter are questioned and Jesse Overton admits to having the scooter on the night of the murder but says he does not know where it is .

Grissom immediately calls  Sara and asks  Sara to check  Brenda for sexual abuse .  Sara examines the photographs of the crime scene and tries to put together a timeline .  Sara realizes that the evidence does not fit their theory that the killer murdered the mother first and then killed the father as he tried to save his daughter . The blood drops actually indicate that the father was leaving  Brenda ’s room , and that the husband was killed first .

Sara discovers that  Brenda was being sexually abused , causing  Grissom and Brass to interrogate  Tina again .  Tina reveals that  Sara was also abused by  Sara father as a young girl and that  Brenda is actually  Sara daughter as well as  Sara half - sister .  Sara killed  Sara father in order to protect  Brenda from the same abuse , and had  Sara mother and brothers killed because they never tried to protect  Sara and never even acknowledged how  Sara clothes were getting bigger and that  Sara was pregnant .  Tina admits that while  Tina learned to cope with the abuse and accepted it , when  Tina saw  Sara father walk into Brenda \\'s room late at night - enough was enough .

At the morgue ,  Sara is going over the body from the desert when  Grissom arrives ;  Sara tells  Grissom that  Sara was just looking and has n\\'t touched it . They find flour on the victim \\'s head ;  Grissom asks if there are any fibers in the neck wound , and  Sara tells  Grissom that  Sara observed some yellow fibers but has n\\'t removed them yet .  Sara does so , and examines them , noting that they \\'re probably silk ;  Grissom comments that the victim is wearing a dress shirt , but no tie , and wonders if  Grissom was strangled with  Grissom own tie .   Doc Robbins tells  Grissom that the body from the desert is Oliver Dunn , adding that his wife came in to identify the body . He notes that there are three bullets in the body ;  Grissom asks about the cause of death , and is told that  Dunn died of asphyxiation .  Grissom wonders why someone would shoot a person that they \\'d strangled ;  Sara comes in with the information that the flour on  Dunn Dunn \\'s head was pizza flour . In the interview room , Det . O\\'Riley asks  Ben where  Ben gun is ;  Ben says that  Ben lost it .  Grissom asks if  Grissom has a job ;  Ben tells  them that  Grissom works at Dante \\'s Pizza , as a delivery boy .  Grissom tells  Ben that  them found flour on  Dunn Dunn \\'s head and asks  Ben to explain how it got there , but  Ben says that  Ben does n\\'t know ;  Ben does n\\'t come in contact with the flour , just the pizza boxes .  Ben then tells  Grissom that  Ben does n\\'t have to talk ;  Grissom tells  Ben that  them \\'ll find out everything from the evidence .  Ben asks  Ben , \" If you know so much about these murders , what do you need me for ? \"  Grissom is intrigued , and asks , \" Murders ? \" , stressing the fact that it \\'s plural .   In the desert ,  Nick and Sara go over the ground in the area where  Ben was discovered , using a radar device to check the ground ; they find another body .  Grissom asks  Ben if there are any more bodies and tells  Ben that they \\'ll radar the whole hillside if they have to . As  Grissom walks away ,  Ben tells  Ben that  Ben \\'s not a bad person ;  Grissom does n\\'t believe  Ben .   In the desert , while the team is uncovering the second body , Father Powell arrives to talk to  Grissom ; he tells  Grissom that  Ben is a member of his parish and is in need of spiritual guidance . With the body uncovered ,  Nick notes that there are no ligature marks on the neck , which is different from the first body that they found ;  Nick also finds a wallet in the man \\'s jacket pocket , with a driver \\'s licence identifying  Nick as Kenny Ramirez .  Sara comments that there seems to be no connection between the two victims , and it makes no sense . Det .  O\\'Riley arrives and tells them that Oliver Dunn \\'s car has been found by highway patrol officers at a gas station .  Grissom asks if there was a second car there as well ;  O\\'Riley says yes , and checks  Grissom notes , then says that the second car belonged to a Mr. Ramirez .   In the desert , at the gas station ,  Nick and  Sara talk to the gas jockey , who tells them that  Grissom did n\\'t see anything , which they find hard to believe .  Grissom admits that  Grissom buddy came along and  Grissom went for a ride with  Grissom , which  Grissom \\'s not supposed to do and if  Grissom boss finds out ,  Grissom \\'ll lose  Grissom job .  Grissom says that  Grissom was only gone a short time , but when  Grissom got back , the two cars were there at the pumps , so  Grissom checked them out , then saw the blood on the ground and called the police .  Nick looks around and notes that there \\'s no blood on the ground now ; the gas jockey says that he hosed  it off as  it was freaking him out .   At the lab ,  Grissom examines  Ben \\'s car ; Father Powell arrives to talk to  Grissom about  Ben .  Ben tells  Grissom that  Ben is a good kid , that  Ben goes to mass every Sunday , and that  Ben problem is that  Ben tries to please people .  Grissom sprays the seats of the car with Luminol , and tells Father Powell that it will show if there \\'s blood in the car ; it shows blood on all the seats , and Father Powell looks horrified . He tells  Grissom that  Ben would n\\'t do this , but  Grissom says that  Grissom believes the evidence in the car .    Sara and  Nick have bullets which they collected from the gas station ; they \\'re from a Lorcin .380 , which is the same pistol used on Oliver Dunn , and the blood in  Ben \\'s car matches both Oliver Dunn and Kenny Ramirez , as well as the red fibers , which  Sara has matched to the carpet from  Ben \\'s car .  Nick tells  Grissom that  Ben killed Dunn and Ramirez ;  Grissom says that the evidence only shows that  Grissom had the bodies in the car and buried them ;  Grissom wants them to find the gun that was used , preferably with  Ben \\'s finger prints on  it , and then  Grissom \\'ll believe that  Ben did  it .  Sara asks if  Grissom \\'d like to see the holes in  Grissom hands , and calls  Grissom a Doubting Thomas , and asks if this has anything to do with the Priest that has been hanging around .  Grissom assures  Sara that it has only to do with the evidence .  Nick insists that the evidence does n\\'t get any better than  this , so  Grissom tells them to take  this to the DA .    Nick checks  Ben \\'s criminal record and finds some minor offences but nothing violent ;  Nick then finds Roger Jennings , Ben \\'s brother , who has a lengthy record including many violent offences .  Nick was paroled in 2000 .  Sara arrives ;  Nick tells  Sara that they might have been wrong about  Ben , and shows  Sara  Nick \\'s record .  Grissom goes to the cells to talk to  Ben ;  Grissom asks about  Nick , whether  Nick threatened  Ben to make  Grissom help ?  Grissom says that they know that  Ben only buried the bodies , and wants to know what happened .  Ben is silent .   At Dante \\'s Pizza , Grissom and  O\\'Riley find  Nick making pizzas . They question  Nick ;  Nick says that  Nick was n\\'t at the gas station , now that  Nick has a job ,  Nick \\'s staying clean .  Grissom suggests that  Ben has told them that  Nick killed the two men , but  Nick says that  Ben would never say that .  Grissom says that  Grissom knows that  Nick shot Mr. Ramirez and strangled  Dunn Dunn with  Grissom own tie ;  Nick says that  Ben did  it , and told  Nick about  it , but  Nick refused to help  Ben dispose of the bodies , telling  Ben that  Ben was on  Ben own .  O\\'Riley asks  Ben what could have set  Ben off like that , and  Nick suggests that it was just tempers out of control , that  Ben got angry at Mr. Ramirez for cutting in front of him at the gas station and shot him , and then strangled Mr. Dunn , who was probably just a by - stander who got too nosy .  Grissom tells  Nick that the killer left flour on  Dunn Dunn \\'s face , and says that it was n\\'t from the gunshot , it was personal , and adds that for a killer to change  Grissom M.O. from shooting to strangling there are only two reasons : entertainment or necessity .  Grissom asks  Nick which it was , but  Nick insists that  Nick does n\\'t know what they \\'re talking about .    Nick and  Sara go to Roger Jennings trailer home to look for the missing tie ;  Sara finds some dry cleaning and notes that dry cleaning is expensive , but the trailer home is low rent . Examining the clothing in the bags ,  Sara finds a stain that could be blood ;  Nick comments that it could just be red sauce . While  Sara tests the stain ,  Nick checks the area outside the trailer and finds a barrel with  ashes in it ; poking around ,  Nick finds a gun in  ashes ashes .  Sara comes out and tells  Nick that the stain tested positive for blood ;  Nick shows  Sara the gun , a Lorcin .380 .   At the station ,  Nick is put in a cell , and walks by the cell where  Ben is .  Nick stares at  Nick angrily as  Nick walks by ;  Ben looks sad . In the lab ,  Grissom does ballistics tests on the gun that  Nick found ; the gun jams while  Grissom \\'s testing it , and the technician tells  Grissom that the striations on the bullet do n\\'t match the ones found in the bodies .  Grissom suggests that  Nick did something to the barrel of the gun to change the striation pattern ;  Sara comes in with the blood test results : the dry cleaning rendered the blood untestable , so there \\'s no evidence there .  Nick is released from jail ;  Nick collects  Nick belongings and leaves while  Ben watches  Grissom from the cell .  Grissom stops  Nick on the way out and asks  Nick if the gun jammed while  Nick was shooting , adding that that \\'s why  Nick strangled  Dunn Dunn ; it was necessity .  Nick says nothing and leaves .    Sara gives  Grissom a note to see DA ; on the news , there \\'s a report that  Ben has been arrested for the murders .  Grissom talks to the DA ;  Grissom tells  Sara that there \\'s no evidence to say that  Ben committed the murders . DA Childs shows him the new evidence in the case : the missing yellow tie , which was turned in by  Nick that morning . He told the DA that  Ben had asked him to hide it ;  Grissom says that since  Nick brought it in , that would explain why  Grissom epithelials are on it ; DA Childs says that it does n\\'t explain why  Ben \\'s are on it too .    Grissom asks  Ben how  Grissom skin got on the tie , telling  Grissom that  Nick turned it in ;  O\\'Riley tells  Grissom that  Nick is framing  Grissom for the murders .  Ben says that  Ben does n\\'t know how  Ben skin got there , and recalls what happened ;  Ben picked up the bodies at  Nick \\'s place , then pulled the tie off of  Dunn Dunn \\'s neck and gave it to Roger , who told  Ben to bury the bodies , and that if there was any trouble ,  Ben should just keep  Ben mouth shut .  Ben says that  Ben buried the bodies as a favor to  Nick , and that  Nick told  Ben that if neither one of them talked , then the whole thing would just blow over .  O\\'Riley tells  Ben that  Ben \\'s looking at two counts of murder , and the best that  Ben can hope for is life with no parole .  Grissom asks if  Ben has anything linking  Nick to the murders , but  Ben has nothing .   In church ,  Grissom goes to see the Father Powell ;  Ben says that  Ben knows  they arrested the wrong man ; Father Powell says that  Ben tried to help without breaking  Ben vows .  Grissom comments that 100 years ago ,  they did n\\'t have finger print technology , and 15 years ago ,  they did n\\'t have DNA ; maybe someday ,  they \\'ll have the technology to put the right man in jail . Father Powell suggests that someday ,  they might not need jails , then invites  Grissom to come to mass ;  Grissom says that  Grissom does n\\'t believe in religion ,  Grissom believes in science .   After a brief conversation with Catherine ,  Grissom sees an officer go running by towards the cells .  Grissom follows them and sees  Ben on the floor , bleeding . The officers say that  Grissom did it with  Grissom own teeth ; they try to revive  Grissom ;  Grissom tries to help , then steps back as EMT workers arrive .  Ben is pronounced dead ;  Grissom holds up  Ben hand and looks at the blood on  Ben fingers .   Victim : Shelley Danvers ( deceased )   On the case : Catherine Willows , Warrick Brown , Jim Brass   Brass meets  Catherine and Warrick at the Mediterranean Hotel ; he tells them that Shelley Danvers was found dead in the hotel spa by an employee when she went to lock up for the night .  Warrick talks to the employee , Kim Marita , while  Catherine checks the body .  Catherine notes that the clothing on the body is n\\'t right and asks Ms. Marita if the body was moved at all ? Ms. Marita admits that  Shelley was naked , so she put a robe on her , and says , \" It \\'s not like it \\'s a crime or anything . \"  Catherine and  Warrick inform  Catherine that it is a crime .   Kim Marita tells Warrick that Shelley Danvers went into the spa at 8 p.m. and her body was found at 10 p.m.  Catherine asks if  Shelley used the jacuzzi ; Kim says no , but they question  Catherine truthfulness , noting that  Catherine lied before about the clothing .   At the lab ,  Catherine sees  David wheeling a body into the morgue ;  David tells  Catherine that it \\'s Shelley \\'s . Doc Robbins does the autopsy and tells  Catherine that  Shelley did n\\'t drown , so the jacuzzi theory is out , but  Catherine may have died of heat stroke , which caused multiple organ failure .  Catherine calls  Brass and asks him to get a warrant to search the hotel ;  Warrick arrives and tells  Catherine that  Shelley had a roommate at the hotel , Tina Kolas ; they had both come in from Indiana to stay at the hotel .   At the hotel ,  Warrick examines the room while  Catherine talks to  Tina .  Tina tells them that both  Tina and  Shelley had been drinking , and  Shelley thought that a sauna would help dry  Shelley out .  Warrick finds a ripped shirt ;  Tina says that they had a fight over it the day before in the room , and when  Shelley pulled on it , it ripped in half , and they both laughed over it .  Shelley tells them that  Shelley called from the phone in the room to make an appointment for the sauna ;  Catherine looks at the notepad by the phone and says that they \\'ll have to take that with them ;  Warrick says they \\'ll take the shirt as well .   Kim Marita tells Warrick and  Catherine that she has no record of Shelley Danvers being booked for the sauna ;  Catherine shows  Catherine the notepad from the room , and tells  Catherine that  they \\'ve examined it and found that Shelley Danvers made a note on it that  Catherine had an appointment for the sauna at 8 p.m. and  they \\'ve confirmed that it was  Catherine handwriting ;  Catherine points out that this is interesting , especially since  Shelley died of heat stroke .  Warrick adds that the sauna is kept at 182 degrees , which could kill a person , especially if the sauna were n\\'t checked .  Brass tells Kim that he has  Brass check - up sheet for the sauna , and no hotel employee checked the sauna after 7:30 p.m. , so  Shelley was in there from 8 p.m. until Kim went to lock up at 10 p.m. Kim explains that she dressed and moved the body in order to protect the reputation of the hotel ;  Catherine tells  Catherine  Catherine was hiding negligent homicide .   The next morning ,  Catherine and  Warrick arrive at the lab to find  Brass waiting for them ; he tells them that he has new evidence : a hotel patron called to say that he \\'d seen  Shelley and  Tina fighting in the casino and they seemed to be fighting over a guy . He says that this is how the shirt got ripped , not the way that  Tina had previously told them . They head out to the hotel .    Catherine and Warrick tell  Tina that Shelly died from anaphylactic shock , they missed it until they saw the room service bill for the food that the two girls ordered . Brass comments that the airline records show that  Shelley said  Shelley was allergic to shellfish , and the room service bill shows that two bowls of \" A Taste From The Sea \" containing pureed shellfish were ordered .  Catherine tells  Tina that  they know that  Shelley made a date with someone named Jeremy ;  Tina tells  they that  they met Jeremy in a bar , and  Catherine heard  Shelley make the date with  Shelley .  Catherine asks if  Catherine killed  Shelley over a guy that  they met in a bar ;  Tina says that  Catherine did n\\'t think the shellfish would kill  Shelley ,  Catherine thought  Catherine \\'d just get hives or something and miss the date .  Catherine tells  Tina that  Shelley \\'s allergies kicked in at the worst possible time ; when  Catherine was alone in the sauna ; the reaction caused  Catherine blood to stop running through  Catherine veins , and  Catherine organs shut down .  Tina comments that  Catherine did n\\'t even like the guy ,  Catherine just did n\\'t want to be left out ;  Brass arrests  Catherine .']\n",

They immediately ask if  Mike was sexually abusing  Jane , but  Jane refuses to talk , saying  Jane loved  Mike .  Nick and Warrick find that in one of the photos , a thumb is in the shot , which  Nick says is strange for a professional photographer .     Jane seems upset by  Grissom 's insensitivity when  Mike asks  Jane to clear up some ground beef , saying that  Mike should know  Jane 's a vegetarian by now .  Grissom merely shrugs and tells  Jane to get  Nick to clean it up before going to talk to  Russ .  Russ says  Russ always thought  Mike was ' touchy - feely ' with  Jody and lets them examine  Mike handgun . Warrick tells  Jane the accelerant in the fire was nail polish remover , suggesting a woman started the fire .  Catherine sees that  Jody has a burn on  Catherine wrist , but  Catherine says it is from a curling iron .

Brass confronts Jane-  Catherine cancelled  Catherine wedding with  Mike 5 days ago and  Mike thinks  Catherine knew  Mike was abusing  Catherine daughter .  Jane denies this and later Greg tells the CSIs that the semen on  Jody 's nightgown is not  Mike 's or  Catherine fathers , but is actually from  Jake brother Jake .    Jake denies doing anything to  Jake sister , but  Brass does n't believe  Jake .  Nick talks to  Jake alone and discovered that  Jake had a wet dream and used the first thing in the laundry hamper to clean up- but was too embarrassed to admit it .  Jake also says that it was  Jody who seemed obsessed with  Mike .     Grissom discovers the bullet that killed  Mike was made of frozen beef which is why it melted and all they found was cow tissue . Brass questions  Russ and finds out that although  Russ gun was clean ,  Russ reloader had beef in it .  Russ says  Russ ' knew '  Mike was abusing  Jody and confronted  Jody , before killing  Jody .

      "s04e15 ['Synopsis The whole team investigates the execution - style murder of a husband and his porn star wife in a gated community .  Catherine gets involved with one of the suspects , even after  Grissom questioned  Catherine ethics when  Catherine told  Grissom  Catherine accepted Sam Braun \\'s check .   Plot Victim : David Trent ( deceased ) , Laurel Trent ( deceased )   On the case : Entire team   In a gated community , Laurel Trent backs out of her driveway and sees her husband , David , get attacked by a masked assailant . She is dragged out of the car , and both end up getting killed .  Catherine and  Grissom meet Brass at the Trent residence . Brass tells them that the Trents were owners of a club called the Acid Drop , along with a few other clubs . Mike was also the co - owner of a semi - pro hockey team . Both of them were shot execution style in the back of the head .  Grissom notices that  Laurel was left in the place where  Laurel was shot , but  David appears to have been dragged down the driveway , as there is a long blood streak leading from a blood pool to  David \\'s body .  David wonders why someone would drag a body to a place where everyone could see it .    Catherine and Warrick look at an array of photos of the Trents on a living room table , where  Catherine immediately guesses that  Laurel is a prototypical Vegas trophy wife .  Nick and  Sara arrive on the scene ;  Brass tells them that there are two gates in the community - one has a guard stationed at it at all times , while the other one requires punch - code access . They approach  Grissom , and  Grissom has them search the perimeter of the yard to find evidence of the assailants .  Greg arrives late on the scene to assist , but  Greg is clearly unprepared . Warrick gives  Greg a lesson in professionalism and preparedness to help  Greg the future .    Sara checks the side yard of the house and finds cigarette butts and orange peels on the ground .  Sara envisions the killer standing there waiting and smoking on a cigarette . He pulled an orange from the nearby tree and ate it , as well . After meeting up with  Sara ,  Nick discovers some bike treads in the dirt . He follows them out to the street where he finds dirty tire tracks . Similar to  Sara \\'s vision ,  Nick envisions the killers riding down from the hill on bikes into the community .    Greg joins  Catherine in the house . Despite the Trents being killed outside ,  Catherine is hoping to find evidence inside the house that makes the crime scene outside make senese .  Catherine has  Greg get on  Greg hands and knees to look for evidence in the carpet of the master bedroom , while  Catherine looks through the closets and drawers . The jewelry box on top of one of the dressers is empty and  Catherine asks  Greg to photograph it . Meanwhile ,  Greg has found a few blood drops in the carpet and  Greg also comes across a storage box that contains amateur pornographic films that star Laurel .  Catherine looks at one of the video cassettes and reads that it is a \" Goode / Mike T. production . \"  Catherine guesses that the \" Mike T. \" is Mike Trent , who likely produced  Catherine in the film and then seduced  Catherine .   In autopsy , Doc Robbins tells  Grissom that  Laurel had had work done in the past , which  Grissom finds uninteresting .  Laurel cause of death was two gunshots to the back of the head , but that \\'s not what Doc Robbins wanted to show  Grissom . Mike Trent had two burn marks on the back of his neck , which  Grissom immediately recognizes came from a stun gun . The doc wonders why someone would get close enough to Mike but not shoot him right away .  Grissom wonders if the killers were biding time for something .    Nick and  Warrick walk through the gated community and theorize about the events .  Warrick guesses that the perpetrators killed the Trents and went in the house to steal the jewelry .  Nick adds that  they got away on bikes , which  Nick thinks is on the low end .  Warrick points out that speeding away in a car would create a lot of noise in a neighborhood like that , but leaving quietly on bikes would be an easier getaway .  they reach the gate that requires punch - code access . After  Nick mentions that one of the killers was eating an orange ,  they use an acid that will light up under the ALS . The acid is applied , and  they see that the numbers 1,3,5 , and 6 were punched in . The killers appear to have had the code .    Grissom is doing evaluations and pulls  Catherine into  Grissom office in order to complete  Catherine .  Grissom says  Catherine would be a good supervisor after  Catherine complains about having no personal life , saying  Catherine has n’t had sex in 7 months .  Catherine wonders how  Grissom is able to juggle everything ;  Grissom replies that the goal of a supervisor is to train someone to take  Grissom place .  Grissom acts coy about possibly leaving CSI some day and notes that  Catherine would make a good supervisor ; however ,  Catherine using the lab to administer a DNA test was unethical .  Grissom does not write this down on the evaluation .  Catherine then admits that Sam Braun gave  Catherine a check and that  Catherine cashed it . A stunned  Grissom says that since Sam was a murder suspect , it looks like a payoff . Despite  Catherine saying  Catherine confirmed with an attorney that it was n\\'t ,  Grissom accuses  Catherine of compromising the lab in an unethical , if not illegal , way .    Catherine , still a little steamed from  Catherine meeting with Grissom , joins  Sara as  Sara is going through the evidence .  Sara says that the cigarette butts and orange peels will be logged and sent to DNA .  Laurel \\'s purse contains both money and credit cards , which seems odd since  Sara had the purse on  Sara when  Sara was killed .  Sara tells  Catherine that  Sara found a wadded up piece of paper in the briefcase that turned out to be a release form allowing  Laurel to shoot a pornographic film at the Acid Drop . The film is made by Drake the Snake productions and the form was signed by a Drake Snow .    Catherine pays a visit to the Acid Drop and speaks to its manager , Chris Bezich .  Catherine is surprised to find out that  Laurel was n\\'t a trophy wife ;  Mike genuinely cared for  Catherine and would do anything for  Catherine .  Chris tells  Catherine that  Chris has run  Mike \\'s clubs ever since  Mike got out of the partner business with Kyle Goode .  Catherine asks about Drake Snow , who happens to be the club bartender and a wannabe porn director .  Catherine and  Chris then formally introduce themselves to each other and there appears to be a spark between them .  Catherine goes to speak to Drake ;  Mike tells  Catherine that the last thing  Mike wanted to be was partners with  Mike . Drake tells  Catherine that he just needed a location to shoot his film and he gave the release form to  Laurel . He admits that the last time he asked  Mike for a favor involving  Laurel ,  Mike punched  Mike in the kitchen of the Trent \\'s residence .  Catherine gets a sample of Drake \\'s DNA .   In the CSI garage ,  Warrick has rounded up the abandoned bikes found near the Trent \\'s neighborhood .  Nick applies the same acid that was applied to the keypad earlier and finds sugar on the handlebars of both bikes , similar to what was found on the keypad .  Warrick figures that finding a serial number will be difficult since they are not recorded ; however ,  Warrick , remembering  Warrick days as a sports bettor , removes one of the bike seats and finds a piece of paper inside . The name on the paper is Ross Davis . Under interrogation from  Grissom and Warrick , Ross reveals that he was jumped by two muscular guys and his bike was stolen . He has a pain in his neck , which  Grissom sees is from a stun gun , similar to what was used on Mike Trent .    Greg talks to  Catherine in the hallway and recaps the DNA evidence  Greg has found - there was something foreign on the cigarette butts , so  Greg sent them to  Trace . The blood  Greg found in the bedroom belonged to Drake Snow , meaning that  Greg told the truth about being hit , but lied about where it happened . Drake \\'s DNA was found on three of the four cigarette butts , with the fourth butt having DNA from an unknown female . There are two additional male donors on the orange seeds , but  Greg has yet to find a match in CODIS .    Brass interrogates Drake Snow , who admits to being in the Trent \\'s bedroom .  Greg claims  Greg was begging  Laurel for business for  Greg production company . Mike walked in and punched Trent in the face . He tells  Brass that he knows the business and just needed capital , which is why he approached  Laurel . Drake says that he had nothing to gain from the deaths of Mike and  Laurel . When confronted with the fact that his DNA was found on cigarette butts outside the Trent house , Drake says that it \\'s not possible . He has one cigarette per day and it \\'s by the service register at the Acid Drop .    Catherine visits Chris Bezich at the Acid Drop again , and he confirms Drake \\'s cigarette story .  Catherine takes a sample of sand from the ashtray and bags it . Afterwards ,  Catherine and  Chris share a passionate moment . Meanwhile ,  Brass pays a visit to  Sara .  Catherine had been sucking down cough drops at the crime scene earlier , and  Brass is able to figure out that  Catherine was hiding alcohol breath .  Sara admits to having had a few beers with breakfast , but then got called the crime scene .  Sara is adamant with  Brass that  Sara did n\\'t have more than that .    Grissom has photographs of  Laurel \\'s jewelry on  Grissom desk .  Brass enters and tells  Grissom the insurance company valued the jewelry at more than $ 2 million and that every pawn shop in town has been notified . A perplexed  Grissom still wonders aloud while Mike \\'s body was dragged down the driveway , but  Laurel \\'s was n\\'t . Brass informs him that Mike Trent \\'s ex - business partner , Kyle Goode , has sued Mike .   In  Trace , David Hodges shows  Catherine the cigarette butts under a microscope . The sand on the butts is a match to the sand from the ashtray at the Acid Drop . However , the orange seeds and orange peel found have trace amounts of soil on them , while the cigarette butts do not .  Catherine wonders if the butts taken from the Acid Drop and planted to implicate Drake . This might also explain why the DNA of an unidentified female was found on one of the butts , as well .   Kyle Goode and his son , Alex , are at a video arcade when  Brass pays them a visit .  Alex tells  Brass that  Alex father drove  Alex to  Alex grandmother \\'s house in Laughlin , a 2 1/2 hour drive from Vegas .  Alex fell asleep in the car , but knew it was 11:00 based on a TV show  Alex watches .  Kyle confirms this and says that they left town at 8 AM and stopped to pick up breakfast sandwiches from a place called Sunny Side on the way .  Kyle leaves with  Kyle son , but not before  Kyle discards one of  Kyle cigarettes .  Brass picks up the butt with a cloth to preserve it as evidence .  Nick pays a visit to Sunny Side and speaks to Missy Wilson , who was running the window the morning  Kyle drove through with  Kyle son .  She recognizes  Kyle from  Kyle photo and is disgusted that  Kyle hit on  She in front of  Kyle son .  Nick asks to see the surveillance tapes from around that time .   In the A / V lab ,  Nick and  Grissom watch the surveillance tapes and see the incident between  Kyle and Missy , confirming  Kyle \\'s alibi .  Grissom notices something in the video and has  Nick rewind the tape . They zoom in and see something that looks like a canteen around  Alex \\'s neck . However , in the still photo , it appears that  Alex is bringing the canteen up to  Alex eyes .  Nick tells  Grissom that  Grissom \\'ll enhance the stills and see what  Grissom can find .    Grissom is called to a crime scene in an apartment where there is a dead male victim . The victim has several stun gun marks on  Grissom and  Grissom was shot twice in the back of the head . David Phillips puts the time of death at within the last hour .  Grissom notices something hanging out of the victim \\'s pocket and pulls out a gold chain with two initials charms on it ; the initials are \" M \" and \" T. \" Grissom and Brass wonder where the rest of the jewelry is .  Grissom walks to the window and looks down to the ground .  Grissom is then seen walking around the outside of the residence , where  Grissom discovers two blood drops on a piece of fiberglass .  Grissom follows the trail further to find the body of another male victim . Next to the victim is a 9 mm handgun and a pillowcase full of jewelry and $ 20,000 . Brass meets up with  Grissom and says  Grissom found a knife with blood on it .  Grissom shows  Grissom the body , and  Brass replies that the whole thing screams \" hit - for - hire . \"  Grissom says that this means they \\'re still looking for someone .   In autopsy ,  Grissom and Doc Robbins look over the bodies . Victim # 1 had several stun gun marks on  Grissom and two bullets to the back of the head ; victim # 2 had a shallow knife wound to the stomach . A flashback shows victim # 1 stabbing victim # 2 with the knife , and victim # 2 responding with the stun gun and the 9 mm handgun . Brass talks to  Catherine in the hallway ;  Grissom tells  Catherine that the Trent \\'s bank says that  Mike and  Laurel were supposed to stop by the safety deposit box that morning and then take a trip to Hawaii later in the week . It seems that  Laurel cleaned out  Laurel own jewelry box and that the thieves took the jewelry as a reward after killing  Laurel and  Mike .    Sara and  Warrick are going over each of the $ 100 bills found individually .  Sara finds a blood stain on one of the bills and has  Greg run the blood against everyone in the case . Meanwhile ,  Nick shows the blown up still photos of Kyle Goode and his son ; the item around  Alex \\'s neck was binoculars . The series of still photos show that  Kyle got quite angry at  Kyle son for wearing them .    Grissom and  Nick pay another visit to the Trent residence and stand outside .  Grissom looks around and notices an empty lot up on a hill .  Grissom goes to the spot , calls  Nick , and has  Grissom move up the driveway until  Grissom is out of  Grissom \\'s sight . A flashback shows Mike Trent \\'s body being dragged down the driveway while Kyle Goode watched through binoculars . This was done to prove that the murders were carried out .  Grissom also notices paint transfer on a barrier in front of  Grissom and calls  Brass to have  Grissom put an APB out on  Kyle \\'s vehicle .    Grissom and Brass have  Kyle brought in for questioning .  Grissom reveals that they tested  Alex \\'s hair and found traces of ambien in it .  Kyle drugged  Kyle own son and used him as an alibi for when the Trents were murdered .  Kyle admits that  Kyle hated Mike Trent and was irate that Mike had kicked  Kyle out of their business and invested the money in clubs .  Kyle denies having anything to do with Mike \\'s death , but  Brass tells  Kyle that a paper cut gave  Kyle away . A flashback shows Mike handing the $ 20,000 to the two thieves and cutting his finger on one of the bills in the process . The DNA on the bill was a match to  Brass DNA Brass pulled from the cigarette in the arcade . Another flashback shows Mike Trent being hit with the stun gun so that he was alive to see his wife get killed . Mike was then killed himself and dragged down the driveway into  Kyle \\'s view to prove that the deed was done .  Grissom points out that  Kyle \\'s hatred of Mike was stronger than  Grissom love for  Grissom own son . At the end of the episode  Catherine leaves and says  Catherine has some unfinished business to deal with . Most likely being sex with  Chris after they kissed .']\n",
      "s03e19 ['Synopsis When a man is found stabbed in the neck at the back of a movie theatre while the movie is still playing ,  Grissom and  Catherine follow the evidence to a case of life imitating art . Meanwhile , Warrick , Nick and Sara have to piece together what happened in a bizarre case of a teenage boy shot in the chest in an empty warehouse with 109 bullet holes in every direction over the walls .   Plot Victim : Gus Sugarman ( deceased )   On the case : Catherine Willows , Gil Grissom , Jim Brass   A movie theater usher approaches a male patron after the show has begun because the patron ’s cell phone is ringing . When the man is unresponsive , the usher taps him on the shoulder . He slumps forward and bleeds from the mouth into his popcorn .    Catherine and  Grissom meet  Brass at the theater .  Brass tells them that the victim is Gus Sugarman and that he owns a local dental practice . Commenting that Thursday is “ Film Noir Night ” at the Art House Movie Theater ,  Brass does his impression of a film noir cop , describing the crime scene , noting that no one heard anything – no scream , nothing to indicate a struggle . The other patrons , however , did hear his cell phone ring three times .  Grissom notes that with the loud music , four exits , and everyone focused on the screen , it \\'s easy to do the deed and slip out .   Doc Robbins is called to the scene to examine the body . He indicates that there is a puncture wound at the back of the victim ’s neck and markings around his mouth . The bruising around the victim ’s mouth seems to suggest that  someone approached the victim from behind had  someone or her hand over  someone mouth .  Grissom sees a small red line on  Grissom neck , leading the team to speculate that a chain or some other similar item may have been torn off the victim .  Catherine drops  Catherine flashlight ; when  Catherine finds it ,  Catherine also finds a bloody screwdriver . Brass re - enters the theater , having been out in the lobby talking to the rest of the theatergoers .  Grissom indicates that  Grissom has located a witness .    Grissom accompanies Brass to speak to  Grissom “ witness ” , a twenty - something movie buff . When asked what he saw , the young man says that he noticed a woman leaving during the gunfight in the movie . He thought  it was odd , since  it is the best part of the film . When asked to describe  Catherine he says that  Catherine was tall , with red hair and “ not old . \"  Catherine woman is not in the lobby with everyone else . Nobody else saw  Catherine woman enter the lobby , either ; the manager was not on duty and the usher left before the police arrived because he had been smoking marijuana and did n\\'t want to get busted .    Catherine has taken the screwdriver  Catherine found at the movie theater back to the lab for review . Noting that is it is covered in blood , soda , popcorn and carpet fibers ,  Greg and another lab tech ,  Julie , begin to work on the screwdriver –  Greg works on the blood trying to match it to the victim ’s , while  Julie uses ninhydrin ( a chemical which reacts with amino acids ) to try and lift any prints that may be on the weapon .    Grissom begins to review the records from  Gus \\'s cell phone . The phone company unblocks all the previously noted private numbers for the purposes of the investigation .  Grissom notes that at 10:38 , two minutes before the start of the movie ,  Gus made a 26-second call . Because the length of the call is so short ,  Grissom guesses that  Gus got someone ’s answering machine . Interestingly , though , the person  Grissom tried to reach called  Grissom back three times in a row , at 11:26 , 11:27 and 11:28 .    Catherine and  Grissom arrive at the house of the Audrey Hilden , the woman who called Gus .  Catherine matches the description of the woman seen leaving the theater . When asked about the calls ,  Catherine tells them that  Gus was  Catherine dentist .  Gus had asked  Catherine out on a date , but  Catherine stood  Gus up .  Catherine was screening  Catherine calls when  Gus called  Catherine , but after an attack of conscience ,  Catherine called  Gus back hoping to get  Gus voice mail and leave an apology message .  Grissom notices a schedule for the Art House Movie Theater posted on a bulletin board in Ms. Hilden ’s house .  Catherine tells  Grissom that  Catherine frequently sees movies there .  Grissom asks  Catherine if  Catherine is a fan of Alfred Hitchcock , but  Audrey tells  Grissom  Catherine prefers French new wave films .    Catherine ,  Grissom , and  Brass regroup to discuss their case . The blood on the screwdriver is their victim ’s and the ninhydrin process managed to reveal a palm print . Unfortunately , the print is smooth , indicating the killer was wearing gloves . Most interestingly , however ,  Brass has uncovered that Audrey Hilden had filed a lawsuit against Gus Sugarman , claiming he assaulted her while she was under anesthesia during a visit .  Gus counter sued and  Audrey dropped  Audrey case .  Catherine is immediately suspicious – after all , why would someone agree to go out on a date with someone  they had accused of molesting  they ?  Brass also spoke to the usher again ; the usher remembers a red - headed woman making a phone call during the movie .   Back at the movie theater , Catherine , Grissom , and  Brass question the usher .  He says that while  He was taking a small break to get a drink ,  He noticed a tall redhead leave the theater and make a phone call on the payphone in the lobby . Brass leaves to check out the phone records .  Catherine asks if the usher noticed anything else , such as whether or not the woman was wearing gloves . Yes ,  Catherine was , the usher says , which he thought was weird since was over 70 degrees inside the theater . He also noticed that  Catherine threw something in the trash and then left the building completely . However , the trash is empty .  Catherine and  Grissom catch up with the cleaning crew in the actual theater . There they notice one of the workers wearing leather gloves , which  Catherine apparently had picked from the trash . Believing they belong to the killer , Gil offers the worker cash in exchange for the gloves , which  Catherine surrenders .    Greg has examined the gloves suspected to be the killer ’s . Because the cleaning woman was using ammonia , any evidence on the interior lining of the gloves , such as epithelial skin cells , was destroyed the moment the cleaning lady put the gloves on . However , they are able to “ print ” the gloves and determine that the palm print found on the murder weapon was indeed made by someone wearing the gloves . In addition , a similar impression has been found on the pay phone in the lobby of the theater and it , too , matches the gloves .    Brass is in  Brass office discussing the case with  Catherine and  Grissom .  Brass has pulled the phone records from the payphone and found out that someone called  Audrey ’s house from that phone at 11:25 . Remembering that Audrey called Gus from  Audrey home at 11:26 ,  they realize  Audrey ca n’t be the killer .  they get the feeling that someone else may be involved .  Brass hypothesizes that maybe the call from the lobby came from a hit - man ( or hit - woman ) , but  Catherine says  Audrey could n\\'t afford a powerful attorney . If that \\'s the case , how could  Audrey afford a hit - man ?  They suspect that  Audrey may still have something to do with the case .  Brass suggests that  They go visit  Audrey to question  Audrey further .   After knocking at  Audrey door , the team hears the buzzing of a phone off the hook inside  Audrey ’s house .  They go around back and see that a sliding glass door has been left unlocked . Cautiously ,  They enter the house , and find  Audrey hanging from an upper railing , an extension cord wrapped around  Audrey neck and a gold necklace lying by  Audrey feet . Grissom recalls something similar to this necklace being yanked off of Gus \\'s neck in the theater .  Brass calls the death in , while  Grissom examines the body and  Catherine heads up the stairs to look at the area around the railing .   During the initial investigation ,  Grissom sees post mortem bruising around  Audrey ’s neck .  Grissom also sees another set of marks around  Audrey neck under the extension cord . This leads  Grissom to believe that  Audrey was strangled first and then hung . In addition ,  Grissom notes there are carpet fibers stuck to the heels of  Audrey shoes , which indicates that  Audrey was dragged across the floor .   Upon further investigation ,  Grissom observes that the movie schedule is missing from  Audrey ’s bulletin board .  Catherine checks the living room trash for the schedule , while  Grissom heads into the bathroom . The trash can does n’t reveal anything , but noting that the floor is wet ,  Grissom plunges the toilet and sees the bright pink schedule stuck in the bowl .  Grissom retrieves it for examination back at the lab .    Catherine and  Grissom have dried out the movie schedule found at  Audrey ’s house and are examining it using digital software , designed to help investigators see smeared ink .  Grissom notices something written above the advertisement for the movie Strangers on a Train .  Grissom gives a summary of the movie - two perfect strangers arrange to commit murders for each other . Since neither person would have a motive for their killing , it would appear to be the perfect murder .  Grissom wonders if this is life imitating art . The software is able to make the note legible ; it reveals the odd phrase “ Sphere E4 - 117 ” .  Catherine surmises that “ Sphere ” may indicate the Sphere Hotel . E4 - 117 is n’t a room number , and after suggesting locker number ,  Audrey and  Grissom believe it may be a parking spot .   Assigned E4 - 117 \\'s parking spot is club manager Anthony Haines . Shown a picture of Audrey Hilden , he does n’t recognize her . While  Catherine questions him further ,  Grissom looks around the group dressing room of dancers at the Sphere Showroom . Spotting another bright pink Art House schedule ,  Grissom asks  Anthony which dancer uses the dressing area  Grissom ’s pointing to .  Anthony indicates Kelly Goodson uses that particular table . Looking closer ,  Grissom notices a business card from the law firm Langly & Langly tucked into the side of her mirror .   Kelly enters the dressing room while  Grissom is looking at her open locker . She pulls of a red wig to reveal long blonde hair . Curious ,  Grissom asks her about the wig and if she ever wears it out . Complaining that she never gets to go out with her work schedule , she begins to rub her legs with a series of muscle creams . Amazed at the concoction she creates ,  Grissom takes note of the three different ointments Kelly is using . She also admits to  Grissom that she has been to the movie theater a few times , but has never seen Strangers on a Train .    Grissom sits at a lab table , surrounded by tubes of three different muscle ointments .  Catherine walks in and they discuss Kelly Goodson . As  Grissom is examining the gloves , extension cord and gold chain for traces of the creams ,  Catherine tells  Grissom that , like Audrey Hilden , Kelly Goodson had recently filed suit against someone for sexual harassment . That someone was , unsurprisingly , Anthony Haines . Once she found this out ,  Catherine dug deeper and discovered  Audrey and Kelly had used the same law firm , Langly & Langly , in each of their cases . Believing that  Audrey and Kelly had met at their lawyer ’s office ,  Catherine and  Grissom speculate that the two women discussed their respective problems and decided to help each other get rid of the causes – Gus Sugarman and Anthony Haines .    Grissom believes that the same cream concoction that Kelly uses could be on the gold necklace and the extension cord used to hang  Audrey .  Catherine tells  Grissom that  Grissom wo n\\'t get transfer from the gloves , but  Grissom notes that there could be trace on the outside , since one uses a bare hand to put on the first glove . Both  Grissom and  Greg start swabbing the key pieces of evidence .    Catherine and  Grissom meet with Kelly to tell  Catherine their theory in the deaths of both Gus Sugarman and Audrey Hilden . Like in the movie Strangers on Train , they believe Kelly and Audrey made a deal to kill the men that had sexually harassed the other . Since each of the men would be a stranger to his killer , it would be difficult to trace Kelly and Audrey to the murders – they would be committing the perfect crime as is theorized in the movie .  Audrey had never really intended to go through with the murders , but Kelly killed  Gus and called  Audrey to let  Audrey know it was done , and even yanked the gold necklace off of  Gus \\'s neck as proof . When  Audrey refused to kill  Anthony , an angry Kelly killed  Audrey . Confronted with their theory , Kelly denies any wrongdoing .  Grissom tells  Audrey that they have found traces of  Audrey muscle cream on the gloves , extension cord and gold necklace . It appears that Kelly is caught after all .   Victim : Timmy McCallum ( deceased )   On the case : Nick Stokes , Sara Sidle , Warrick Brown , Ray O\\'Riley   Nick , Sara , and Warrick meet Detective O’Riley out at a warehouse , the scene of a gunshot fatality . O’Riley remarks that he hopes the CSIs brought a lot of extra supplies and have a lot of time – the crime scene looks like a war zone . The CSIs are shocked as the door to the warehouse is opened and they can see the sun streaming through what looks like hundreds of bullet holes in the walls . A young male is lying face down on the warehouse floor . His driver ’s permit indicates that he is 15 ½ years old and named Timmy McCallum . He is surrounded by bullet casings , but amazingly only has one bullet wound , which is in the chest .    Sara ,  Nick and Warrick split up their crime scene :  Sara takes outside ,  Nick takes the walls , and  Warrick takes the floor .  Sara notes and photographs tire tracks and footprints outside warehouse . Rounding the back ,  Sara also sees a makeshift ladder leading to the roof , which  Sara climbs . On the roof ,  Sara finds a piece of bamboo , which  Sara tags as evidence and brings down with  Sara . In the interim ,  Nick is inserting small rods into the many bullet holes in the warehouse walls – when done ,  Nick notes there are 109 holes .  Warrick bags beer bottles found at the scene , and numbers each one of the bullet casing found on the floor .  Nick also finds clear shards of glass next to some tiny pieces of black plastic .    Warrick visits Doc Robbins in autopsy .  Timmy \\'s body is peppered with small , round bruises of unknown origin . There is also large scabbing on  Nick elbows and knees , which Doc Robbins chalks up to “ boys will be boys ” . There is no gun shot residue on  Nick body or clothing , indicating  Nick was shot from a distance . Measuring the degree of the path the bullet took in  Nick body ,  Warrick figures out that  Timmy was shot from above . However , the angle of the roof and the angle  Timmy was shot from do n\\'t line up .   Back at the lab ,  Sara is working on the most puzzling piece of evidence : the bamboo .  Warrick interrupts  Sara work to let  Sara know what  Warrick has learned from the pictures  Sara took outside of the warehouse . The tire tread did n\\'t come back with any distinctive result ; however , the footprints did . By measuring the prints and examining the treads ,  Warrick has determined that five people went into the warehouse and four ran out .  Sara admits that  Sara has been unable to locate any fingerprints on the bamboo , and  Warrick proposes they check it for gun shot residue . When that test comes up negative ,  Warrick suggests  Sara abandon the bamboo . Not one to give up ,  Sara takes it to Trace , hoping that will reveal some hidden forensic detail .    Greg has completed the DNA testing of the beer bottles found at the scene of Timmy McCallum ’s shooting .  Greg tells  Nick that one of the bottles has  Timmy ’s DNA but , more importantly , another one has the DNA of a relative of  Timmy ’s , most likely a brother . Interesting news , since  Warrick is about to step into an interview room with  Timmy ’s mom and  Timmy older brother , Kevin .   Mrs. McCallum admits to  Warrick that she knows  Timmy drives the family minivan without her , despite the fact that  Timmy learner ’s permit requires an adult to be in the car . She says that , due to her work schedule ,  Kevin often drives with  Timmy .  Kevin denies having any knowledge of the warehouse , even when confronted with the DNA evidence .  Kevin says that  Kevin bought  Timmy and  Kevin friends the beer , and had taken a couple swigs out of one of the bottles . Believing more can be learned from  Kevin ,  Warrick asks Mrs. McCallum ’s permission for  Kevin to stay for more questioning and to examine the vehicle .   In Trace , the bamboo is looked at in detail and is found to have spiral gouges on it from one end to the other . The glass from the scene has also been examined . It is coated with crystallized calcium chloride , which is common in glass used in high - end camera lenses .    Warrick begins  Warrick review of the McCallum ’s minivan . The tires match the photo of the treads taken at the scene – but this is n’t surprising . After all ,  Timmy often drove the van .  Warrick finds a ripped up beer case in the back of the van , with a price tag on it from Jenko ’s Liquor .  Warrick also finds what appears to be blood on the driver ’s side arm rest . Spraying it with luminol ,  Warrick discovers that it tests positive for blood .   Meanwhile , in the interrogation room , Detective O’Riley is talking to  Kevin .  Nick is watching the interrogation from outside the room . After  Nick and  Warrick swap notes –  Nick tells  Warrick that all the bullets fired came from the same 9 mm semi - automatic weapon and  Warrick tells  Nick about the blood –  they decide to talk to  Kevin themselves . Noticing blood coming through  Nick shirt on  Nick arm ,  they ask  Kevin to show  they the wound .  Kevin reluctantly complies and shows  they what appears to be a wound caused by a grazing bullet . Additionally ,  they ask  Nick to remove  Nick shirt and when  Nick does ,  they see small , round bruises , matching the ones found on  Nick brother ’s body . After that ,  Kevin clams up and refuses to talk anymore .    Sara inputs all the trajectories of all 109 bullets found at the warehouse into a computer simulation .  Sara and  Warrick review the simulation and discover that all the bullets seem to be coming from one long pole from near the center of the warehouse .  Sara theorizes that this could be where the bamboo stick fits in . Adding up all their clues ,  Sara and  Warrick summarize the case . Still unable to figure out what has happened , they realize they are at the end of the road , forensically speaking .   Having pulled the surveillance tapes from Jenko ’s Liquor ,  Nick has black and white stills made of the time that  Kevin was in  Jenko’s ’s buying the beer . Looking closely at the stills , they discover that three other young men accompanied  Kevin and  Timmy into the store . One of the young men had a video camera with him , which may account for the lens glass found at the warehouse .  Nick suggests interviewing the other kids to see which one could have been filming the incident .   The other kids who accompanied  Kevin and  Timmy into  Jenko’s ’s have been identified and called in for questioning . Each of them has bruises identical to  Timmy ’s and are reluctant to talk . One of the boys , however , admits that  he got a black eye after  Timmy shot out the lens in  he video camera with a gun  they “ found ” . From that point , the CSIs simply tell the boys  they can talk or  they will just find out what  they want from the videotape .   Faced with this ,  Kevin begins to tell Detective O\\'Riley what happened . In their boredom , each of the boys came up with stupid Jackass - like stunts to perform on camera . The first one was “ Speedway Surfing , \" where each of the boys stood atop a speeding vehicle and surfed along the highway . Next was “ Human 150 yard Marker , \" where they all took turns standing in front of someone , who shot golf balls at  them , which is how  them ended up with the round bruises .  Timmy ’s choice was “ Bamboo Russian Roulette ” . At the warehouse , they all took turns going up to the roof , inserting the bamboo stick into the warehouse and sliding the semi - automatic down the bamboo . The notches on the bamboo caused the gun to randomly shoot into the warehouse .  Timmy was killed during  Timmy brother ’s turn .']\n",
      "s01e20 ['Synopsis Grissom , Warrick and Sara investigate the death of a deaf man who was run over by a car . However , more investigation shows that he died before the car even struck him . The team \\'s encounters with the dean of the deaf man \\'s school reveals a secret about  Grissom . Meanwhile , Catherine and Nick investigate an apparent mob hit that leaves five dead in a coffee shop and discover that the victim they thought was the target may only have been collateral damage .   Plot Victim : Brian Clemonds ( deceased )   On the case : Gil Grissom , Sara Sidle , Warrick Brown   Two young girls run over a body , thinking they have killed him . When Grissom , Sara , and Warrick arrive on the scene , they see that the victim has two distinctive tread marks on his sweater .  Grissom believes that the victim was already dead when the girls ran  Grissom over . During the search of the crime scene ,  Grissom finds a plastic bag with a six pack of beer in it .   At the autopsy , Doc Robbins informs Grissom , Sara , and Warrick that the victim , named Brian Clemonds , was deaf .  Grissom notes that there is a school for the deaf less than a mile from where Brian \\'s body was found . There is also blood on  Grissom knuckles , indicating that  Grissom was recently in a fight . The blood is not  Grissom .   After  Grissom notifies Brian \\'s mother ,  Grissom and  Sara travel to the school for the deaf to meet with the school \\'s president , Dr. Gilbert .  Sara angers Dr. Gilbert by bringing a translator along without  Sara permission and only speaking to the translator . Dr. Gilbert lets everyone know that she has a hearing aid and can read lips . Insulted , she kicks  Sara , Warrick , and the translator out of her office , telling them they can not investigate the crime if they can not understand the victim and his circumstances .    Sara and  Grissom return to the school with  Grissom who , to their surprise , can speak in sign language .  Grissom is able to get into Dr. Gilbert \\'s good graces and informs her that  Grissom will keep her in the loop during the investigation if she cooperates .  Grissom finds out that  Brian had filed six complaints against  Grissom roommate , Paul Arrington .  Grissom had recently become deaf and had trouble adjusting to  Grissom new circumstances .  Brian requested a new roommate , but was denied .    Grissom is brought in for questioning ;  Grissom does not sign or read lips .  Grissom attaches a device to  Grissom \\'s head ;  Warrick tells  Sara it \\'s called \" brain printing . \" The plan is to show  Grissom pictures of the crime scene with  Grissom brain waves giving  Grissom away should  Grissom recollect the event . The result is negative , however .  Grissom writes down that  Grissom \\'s sorry to Paul , who shoves the paper away and exits .   While checking out  Brian \\'s clothes ,  Warrick finds lice . Greg finds Pyoverdin , a bacteria that forms fluorescent blue dots in the blood , in the blood on  Brian \\'s knuckles . This means that the murder suspect also has Pyoverdin in his blood .  Sara , meanwhile finds a large portion of a VIN number on the broken taillight left at the scene . Combined with the information about the tire tread ,  Sara is able to narrow down the vehicle , as well as it \\'s owner , Adam Walkey .   The murder vehicle is found and  Warrick confirms that there is lice in the driver \\'s seat . A piece of  Adam \\'s clothing is also found in the vehicle \\'s undercarriage , but is wedged in the muffler . This information combined with the broken taillight suggest that  Brian \\'s body was backed over .    Adam is brought in , where tests confirm that  Adam has Pyoverdin in  Adam blood . However ,  Adam is negative for lice .  Grissom and Detective O\\'Riley interrogate Adam , who confirms that  Adam hit someone that night , but kept driving . When pressed with the information that lice was found ,  Adam confirms that  Adam was with  Adam friend , Mark Rucker . During the interrogation , Dr. Gilbert barges in and angrily confronts  Adam before being restrained by  Grissom .    Grissom and Detective O\\'Riley interrogate Mark Rucker , who first claims that they thought they hit a dog and kept on driving . During the interrogation ,  Grissom combs  Mark \\'s hair and finds lice .  Grissom lets  Mark know that there was not only lice in the driver \\'s seat , but also lice on  Brian \\'s sweater . When pressed with this information ,  Mark changes  Grissom statement - after hitting  Brian , both  Grissom and  Adam got out of the car and were going to call 911 .  Adam , supposedly , convinces  Mark not to as  Mark are young with bright futures .    Grissom then relates what  Grissom thinks happened :  Adam and  Mark saw  Brian leave the liquor store with the beer . Since they are underage , they wanted to get  Brian \\'s attention to get  Brian to get them beer . When  Brian , unable to hear them , kept walking ,  Adam and  Mark exited the vehicle and started beating  Brian up . When they got in to drive away ,  Brian appeared in the rearview mirror screaming .  Mark put the car in reverse and backed over  Brian .  Grissom tells  Mark that  Brian was deaf and that the two kids were more afraid of  Brian than  Grissom was of them .    Grissom meets with Dr. Gilbert to let her know they found  Brian \\'s murderers . She asks him how he knows sign language , and  Grissom begins telling her using signs .   Victims : Five victims ( deceased )   On the case : Catherine Willows , Nick Stokes , Jim Brass    Catherine and  Nick are investigating five murders in a coffee shop across town . The victims are Frankie Flynn ( former owner of the Orpheous casino ) and his bodyguard , a guy wearing headphones listening to speed metal , and two teenage girls working in the shop : Erin McCarty and Alice Neely . All bodies are found in the front of the shop except for  Erin \\'s , whose body is found in the back room near the rear exit .   The original thought is that the murders started with a mob hit due to Flynn \\'s previous dealings . Dr. Robbins informs Catherine and  Nick that  Erin was six weeks pregnant . When  Catherine wants to notify the husband , Dr. Phillips tells  Catherine that  Erin is single and lives at home with  Catherine mother .   Every shell casing in the coffee shop is 9 mm . While investigating , Catherine , Nick , and Brass interrogate the store owner , Brad Kendall . During another interrogation ,  Brad states that  Brad knew Frankie Flynn , as  Brad used to work the coffee shop in the Orpheous casino .  Brad also admits that  Brad owns a 9 mm Glock . However , Bobby Dawson concludes that  Brad \\'s gun is not the murder weapon , as the bullet striations do not match the ones on the bullets found at the scene .

      "s05e05 ['Synopsis Grissom , Greg and  Sara investigate when a woman is found dead in the fountain of a gated community after visiting a neighborhood swingers party . Meanwhile , Nick and Warrick investigate the murder of a landlord in a video arcade , which develops into a double homicide . Catherine requests the position of day shift supervisor from  Grissom .   Plot Victim : Vanessa Keaton ( deceased )   On the case : Gil Grissom , Greg Sanders , Sara Sidle , Jim Brass   A wild swingers party is happening in the house of Erin and Paul Brady , and just about every couple in the neighborhood seems to be in attendance . A scream is later heard and Vanessa Keaton is found dead in a fountain in the middle of the cul de sac . Brass catches  Grissom and  Sara up to speed , and  Grissom notices that the onlookers are well dressed .  Grissom is told that there was a party in the neighborhood and  Grissom has  Sara photograph the crowd , for any one of them could be a suspect . David Phillips points out the foam in Vanessa \\'s nose and mouth , which would indicate drowning . Her time of death is put at no more than two hours ago .    Brass questions Vanessa \\'s husband , Dan , and  Brass daughter , Amy .  Dan says that  Dan left the Brady \\'s at 11:00 PM because  Dan was n\\'t in the mood for partying ; however ,  Dan wife was .  Amy tells  Brass that  Amy got home late and broke  Amy 1:00 AM curfew , snuck into the house , and went to bed .  Amy adds that Vanessa is  Amy stepmother . Outside ,  Greg and  Sara process the crime scene while the body is hauled away .  Sara finds a high - heeled shoe in the fountain and quizzes  Greg on what  Greg sees .  Greg guesses that Vanessa had too much to drink , took her shoes off , and played in the fountain . She then walked on the concrete around the fountain , slipped , hit her head , and drowned .  Sara says that there is no blood or hair evidence on the concrete , but  Greg posits that the water could have washed it away . Since the facts are n\\'t completely known ,  Sara has  Greg bag the shoe and take a water sample .   Doc Robbins tells  Grissom that Vanessa \\'s cause of death was a pulmonary adema due to drowning .  Grissom shows  Grissom four uniform puncture wounds on Vanessa \\'s back that occurred perimortem and , since there are no holes in the dress she was wearing , she was n\\'t wearing it when she was stabbed . The doc adds that he collected lubricant from Vanessa \\'s privates and sent a sexual assault example to DNA . When paired with the expensive lingerie Vanessa was wearing , Doc Robbins believes that she had quite a night planned .   David Hodges shows  Greg that the water found in Vanessa \\'s lungs and the water from the fountain are not a match . He adds that the water from the fountain is heavily chlorinated , while the water in Vanessa \\'s lungs contains polymethylhexalene biguanide , a chlorine alternative . From this ,  Greg concludes that Vanessa drowned in a pool or spa . Greg , Grissom and  Sara take water samples of every pool and spa in the neighborhood . Dan Keaton tells  Sara that it \\'s possible that his wife was swimming after he left the party , but that everyone at the party was friends with each other . He claims he would n\\'t have left Vanessa alone with strangers . Meanwhile , at the Brady residence ,  Greg takes a sample of the pool water while Brass and  Grissom talk to the Bradys . Erin Brady says that everyone in the neighborhood took turns hosting parties once per month and she recognizes Vanessa \\'s dress from a photo . In the house ,  Grissom notes how clean everything is despite there being a party the night before .  Grissom spots a case on the kitchen counter ; when  Grissom opens it ,  Grissom sees that two skewers are missing out of a set of four . The skewers could explain the puncture wounds on Vanessa \\'s back .  Erin claims that  Erin does n\\'t know where the other two skewers are . The dishwasher finishes its cycle ; upon opening it ,  Grissom finds several sex toys .    Greg brings lab tech Mia Dickerson a bunch of stuff from the Brady house , including the skewers and 26 used condoms . Mia tests everything and later tells  Greg and  Grissom that , while DNA from the skewers was washed away by the dishwasher , the condoms contained DNA from ten different males and eleven different females , including victim Vanessa Keaton . The DNA results show that Vanessa had sex with four different men the night she died .  Grissom and Brass question  Erin while  Sara talks to  Paul .  Erin admits that  Erin and  Paul are swingers and that it saved their marriage .  Erin admits that the Keatons were invited to the parties because Vanessa was very attractive and into the lifestyle ; however ,  Dan was not . Both  Erin and  Paul maintain that nobody at the party was having an affair and that the parties have rules - arrive as a couple and leave as a couple , no drugs , always wear condoms , no photos , no videos , sex with someone else is allowed only at the parties , and no kids are ever allowed to know . After all of the questioning ,  Sara tells  Grissom that , although  Sara is supposed to be objective ,  Sara has a problem with the lifestyle .  Grissom replies that everyone involved is a consenting adult and that swinging is not illegal .  Sara strongly believes that Vanessa \\'s murder was a crime of passion .    Grissom gets a call and is informed that the water in Vanessa \\'s lungs came from the spa belonging to  Meg and Tom Cunningham , another couple from the party . While  Brass questions them at their house ,  Grissom finds blood evidence on the inside of the spa . The Cunninghams tell  Brass that they left the party at 11:30 PM and went to the Bellgaio for a night out . While  Tom is speaking ,  Tom puts  Tom hand around  Tom wife \\'s shoulder .  Grissom \\'s keen eye notices that  Meg stiffens and looks down at  Tom \\'s hand before relaxing . When told that a DNA sample will be needed ,  Tom admits to having had sex with Vanessa , Erin Brady and Mallory Stone during the party .    Brass questions Meg Cunningham and is able to quickly unravel her story .  Tom tells her that lying for her husband is conspiracy after the fact and that it could land her in jail . The hotel maid at the Bellagio confirmed that  Meg was not with  Meg husband during the night in question ;  Brass adds that  Meg was seen with a blonde in  Meg late 20 \\'s and that the blonde even paid for breakfast with  Meg credit card .  Meg caves and tells  Meg that  Meg lied because  Meg husband told  Meg to think about their son ; however ,  Meg maintains that  Meg has no idea what went on between Tom and Vanessa .    Grissom and Sara go the Cunningham \\'s house to gather evidence . In the study ,  Sara finds a drawer full of pornography ; inside one of the magazines is a webcam photo of a woman from the neck down . The woman in the photo is wearing the same lingerie Vanessa was killed in , so  Grissom and  Sara surmise that the woman in the photo is Vanessa . In the morgue , they pull Vanessa \\'s body from the freezer and , after comparing it with the photo , find that woman in the photo is actually not Vanessa . David Phillips interrupts and shows them bruising on Vanessa \\'s back that was n\\'t there during autopsy . Based on the bruising ,  Grissom and  Sara are able to see that Vanessa was n\\'t stabbed four times with a skewer ; instead , she was stabbed twice with a two - pronged instrument .    Greg goes to the Cunningham house and finds evidence of blood on a barbecue fork . In the lab ,  Sara goes through Tom Cunningham \\'s computer and finds a lot of back and forth between the Cunninghams and Keatons .  Tom received an e - mail from \" sweetkeat \" that contains the photo in question .  Tom replied that  Tom would meet the mystery girl at midnight behind a skate park . Security footage from the park shows  Tom and a blonde getting into the back of  Tom SUV . It \\'s revealed that the blonde is Amy Keaton .  Brass tells  Tom that  Amy is fifteen years old and that  Tom \\'s looking at statutory rape .    Amy is questioned with  Amy father present .  Dan is irate after being told what happened and threatens to kill  Tom .  Amy replies that  Tom loves  Amy and that all of the kids in the neighborhood were aware of the parties .  Grissom shows them the barbecue fork and tells them that the blood on the fork is Vanessa \\'s and that the prints recovered are  Amy \\'s . A flashback shows  Tom and Vanessa sitting in the Cunningham \\'s pool kissing . When  Amy arrived and saw this ,  Amy stabbed  Amy stepmother twice in a fit of jealous rage .  Grissom informs  Amy that the stab wounds did n\\'t kill Vanessa , but  Amy was knocked unconscious and it took  Amy a few minutes to drown .  Amy contends that  Tom was trying to protect  Amy , so they moved the body to the fountain .  Amy continues to ask if  Amy can see  Tom .    Grissom and  Sara walk down the hallway and recite the rules from the swingers party , emphasizing the fact that \" the kids must never know . \"    Victim : Mr. Basengi ( deceased )   On the case : Nick Stokes , Warrick Brown , Chris Cavaliere   In a video arcade ,  Nick and Warrick look over a scene that contains a lot of blood . The victim , which also the establishment \\'s landlord , appears to have been run through the table saw while he was working late . They spot an eviction notice , and  Nick tells Warrick that the evicted tenants are Melissa Poolie and Charlie Pinscher . The eviction notice also seems to eliminate robbery as a motive . They are interrupted by  Marty Gleason , a member of the crime scene cleanup ( or \" bio recovery services \" ) team . Per the landlord \\'s wife ,  Marty wants them to clear the scene so  Marty can get to work , as the new tenant is supposed to move in on the first of the month .    Nick and Det .  Cavaliere talk to Charlie Pinscher , who tells them that  Cavaliere had every dime  Cavaliere owned tied up in the arcade .  Cavaliere went into business with  Cavaliere girlfriend , Melissa Poolie ; however , the relationship did n\\'t work out and she skipped town , leaving  Charlie to come up with the rent .  Charlie admits to having called the landlord the night  Charlie was killed , but they could n\\'t reach an agreement .  Nick takes  Charlie \\'s fingerprints despite  Charlie insisting that  Charlie fingerprints will be all over the arcade .   In the lab ,  Nick and Warrick look over the crime scene photos .  Nick says that the only items brought into the arcade post - eviction were the tools , tarps , and paint cans - none of which contain  Charlie \\'s prints . However , the landlord \\'s prints and some unknown prints were recovered .  Warrick adds that the table saw was a rental , so it could contain many prints irrelevant to the case .  Warrick also believes that , since  blood was everywhere ,  blood likely splashed onto the killer \\'s clothes and shoes .  They are interrupted by the secretary and told that  Marty is there and refuses to leave .  Marty accuses  They of messing with  Marty , as there was a weird smell coming from the scene after  They left . A perplexed  Nick and  Warrick maintain their ignorance and innocence . The three of them head back to the arcade , where the decomp smell is now noticeable .  Nick and  Warrick are unable to immediately pinpoint where the smell is coming from , so  Warrick turns the thermostat all the way up and they all head out to lunch .   While they all eat lunch ,  Marty brags to  Nick and  Warrick about how profitable  Marty crime scene cleanup business is and even offers the CSIs a job , which they quickly decline . The landlord \\'s widow stops by and asks  Marty what is taking so long ; he blames the CSIs while using a fake southern accent to \" put the bereaved at ease . \" Inside the arcade ,  Nick and  Warrick are able to find where the decomp smell is coming from . They open the back of the Ms. Pac Man machine to find a woman \\'s dead body wrapped in plastic .   Charlie Pinscher is brought in for questioning again . From dental records , the dead body is identified as Melissa Poolie , meaning his story of her skipping town was wrong . There is also evidence that  Melissa had sex with the landlord before  Melissa death . A flashback shows  Charlie freaking out about this revelation and killing  Melissa as  Melissa demeaned  Charlie .  Charlie then stuffed  Melissa in the back of the Ms. Pac Man machine ; however ,  Charlie had a problem after being told that  Charlie was being evicted and that the landlord was keeping all of the stuff . Another flashback shows  Charlie asking the landlord for only the Ms. Pac Man machine ; when the landlord refused ,  Charlie pushed  Charlie down into the table saw . Back in interrogation ,  Nick tells  Charlie that when someone is killed with a table saw , blood gets everywhere .  Nick guesses that , despite  Charlie \\'s best efforts ,  Nick likely has the landlord \\'s blood on  Nick somewhere .  Nick admires  Charlie \\'s watch and informs  Nick that phenylthaline can detect the tiniest amount of blood . An increasingly distressed  Charlie admits to killing the landlord accidentally ; however , he is still adamant that he did n\\'t kill  Melissa . In fact , he did n\\'t know  Melissa \\'s body was somewhere in the arcade .   The blood recovered from  Charlie \\'s watch is a match to the landlord , Mr. Basengi .  Warrick visits Doc Robbins , who tells  Warrick that  Melissa \\'s cause of death was blunt force trauma . Based on the depth and width of the wound , the doc guesses that the weapon used could have been a pipe .  Nick and  Warrick head back to the arcade to look for a murder weapon .  Warrick believes that since the table saw was a weapon of opportunity , there might be another one nearby .  Warrick walks around the cash register and finds a baseball bat .   It is revealed that blood in the cracks of the bat belong to  Melissa and that fingerprints recovered from the bat belong to Mrs. Basengi , the landlord \\'s wife . A flashback shows  Melissa and Mrs. Basengi having an argument , with Mrs. Basengi telling  Melissa that sex was an unacceptable form of rent payment .  Melissa told  Melissa to go to hell , to which Mrs. Basengi responded by hitting  Melissa in the back of the head with the bat .  Melissa then wrapped the body in plastic and stuffed it in the back of the Ms. Pac Man machine .    Marty stops Nick and Warrick in the hall and is mad that they closed the case before Mrs. Basengi was able to pay him for his services .  Nick and  Warrick tell  Warrick that  Grissom talked to the Sheriff and that  Marty will get paid , after all .  Marty wonders if  Marty \\'ll be getting a big city contract , but  Nick and  Warrick ignore the question and walk away .   Meanwhile ,  Catherine has learned that Conrad Ecklie has been promoted to Assistant Director .  Catherine speaks with  Grissom and tells  Grissom that  Catherine wants the day shift supervisor job Ecklie left behind in order to spend more time with Lindsey . After  Catherine rambles on ,  Grissom tells  Catherine that the day shift supervisor role includes solving problems , meaning that  Catherine will have to leave  Catherine personal problems at home .  Catherine knows  Catherine is more than capable of handling the position , and  Grissom agrees .  Grissom tells  Catherine that  Grissom sent in  Catherine performance results , gave  Catherine 100 % , and even put in a good word with the Director .  Grissom finishes by telling  Catherine that  Grissom hopes  Catherine gets the position .']\n",

She goes to her baby son \\'s room to find he is missing and the window is wide open with a ladder leaning against it . She also finds a note in the crib saying that the kidnapper will call with instructions in six hours .     Grissom arrives at the scene and the mother and her husband Steve are waiting for him with the ransom note .  Grissom is interested in the open soda bottle on the kitchen counter .  Grissom father informs  Grissom  Grissom opened it when  Grissom called 911 .  Grissom requests an unopened soda bottle , a piece of Zack \\'s ( the baby ) clothing and blood samples from the entire family .  Grissom tells  Sara to examine the ransom note and to take the Anderson \\'s computer printer with  Sara to the lab .  Grissom also gives Nick the opened and unopened soda bottles and tells  Grissom to open the bottle at 72 ° F .  Sara finds out the note does not match the Andersons \\' printer , so  Grissom tells  Sara to get a warrant for all the printers at Mr. Anderson \\'s office .   The scent dogs start barking and  Grissom and Warrick run to meet them . They find  Zack \\'s body carefully placed under a statue at the golf course . The autopsy reveals that  Zack died due to asphyxiation .  Grissom thinks it is possible maybe  Grissom abductor accidentally smothered  Grissom , but Dr. Robbins believes the crime was too violent to have been accidental ;  Grissom sternum was cracked .  Grissom and Catherine talk to the Andersons , explaining why they can not release the body and that the way  Zack \\'s body was treated is not consistent with a stranger having abducted  Grissom .  Grissom and  Catherine find a pair of nylons with green stains , an empty bag that once contained a baby blanket and a roll of rubbish bags , at the Andersons \\' house .   Nick tells  Grissom , at the lab , that the soda bottle was opened at 11:30 pm ( which is not consistent with the time when 911 was called ) . A set of prints on the ransom note is matched to Needra Fenway , Steve Anderson \\'s secretary ; her printer also matches the ransom note .   Fenway says she was having an affair with  Steve , but that she ended it .  Grissom says her hair was found in the crib and  Catherine tells  Catherine that getting rid of Zachary would have been an easy way to end  Steve and  Gwen \\'s marriage . Dr. Kane ( psychologist ) informs  Grissom that  mothers sometimes kill  mothers children in order to avenge their husbands \\' affairs .   Zack \\'s time of death is placed at around 9 pm and Dr. Robbins discovers the fiber that was in his throat is Metaradim , a fire retardant .  Grissom finds an oven mitt at the Andersons \\' house that matches the fiber .  Catherine and  Warrick replay the 911 call . They hear a distressed  Gwen and then  Catherine suggests checking if Tyler ( the older son ) has a cell phone .   At a meeting between  Grissom and  Catherine and the Andersons \\' lawyers , the CSIs are granted three questions for each family member .  Grissom points out that a ransom price was not listed on the note , and asks if it is because  they could not put a price on  they own son . Gwen quickly confesses to the crime and says her husband and older son were only lying to protect her . She tells them she accidentally smothered  Zack with a pot holder , when  Zack would not stop crying .   When  Warrick hears that Gwen and  Steve have been arrested  Zack is very surprised , because on a 911 recording from Tyler \\'s cell phone you can hear  Zack shout \" What did you do ,  Robbie ? \" (  Robbie is the middle son ) . Tyler tells Gil and Brass what happened . His parents were out . He was on the phone with his girlfriend , and when he turned around he saw  Zack dead and his three - year - old brother Robbie standing over him with a pot holder in his hand . He called 911 , but then got disconnected . When his parents returned home they found him performing CPR- the wrong way ; instead of using two fingers on  Zack \\'s chest , Tyler was using his palms , which is what cracked his sternum .    Steve tells Grissom they did not tell the truth , because they did not want  Robbie to have to live with the fact that  Robbie had killed  Robbie baby brother . As  Robbie is three ,  Robbie can not be held liable for  Robbie brother \\'s death , and it is unlikely  Robbie will have any memories of it later in life ,  Gwen is released to be with  Gwen family and to face questions from the press .']\n",

      "s04e05 ['Synopsis A grisly collision between a car and an eighteen - wheeler leads to a murder investigation at a furry convention . Meanwhile , a man is found dead in a freezer in an apparent robbery - homicide .   Plot Victims : Linda Jones ( deceased ) , Robert Pitt ( deceased )   On the case : Catherine Willows , Gil Grissom , Warrick Brown , Jim Brass   On a dimly lit stretch of road , Linda Jones is driving and looking for something . She suddenly collides with something , causing a loud thud . As she looks back to see what she hit , she swerves into oncoming traffic , and collides with an 18-wheeler truck . Later that night , while officers investigate the truck driver ,  Grissom and Catherine follow Linda \\'s tire tracks and see that she was braking for quite a while . They see a set of extremely large animal paw prints leading off the road , and find another victim : a man in a raccoon fursuit .   The next day ,  Grissom and  Willows further investigate the \" raccoon \" .  Willows reveals that she once dated a Detroit Lions mascot , while David Phillips is reminded of a children \\'s show he once loved that starred a raccoon character .  Grissom determines that the raccoon \\'s cause of  death was blunt force trauma by motor vehicle , implying that  Grissom was the \" thud \" that Linda Jones hit before  death death . They also find a piece of blue fur in the raccoon \\'s mouth .   The man in the raccoon suit revealed to be an Alcoholics Anonymous participant . While cutting the man out of his costume , a great deal of blood spills out , as it had nowhere else to escape ; the forensics team finds a high - velocity bullet wound , thus adding to the man \\'s injuries .   In the lab , the blue fur found in the mouth is confirmed synthetic , and the raccoon is identified as Robert Pitt , who was court - ordered to join AA after being arrested for driving under the influence . A sample of  Pitt \\'s digestive system reveals  Pitt had no alcohol in  Pitt , but rather ipecac ( an emetic ) and civet oil ( an aphrodisiac ) .    Catherine and Brass search Robert \\'s residence , where they find a bedroom full of raccoon stuffed animals , as well as a calendar with October 29-November 1 , 2003 , marked as a \" PAF - Con \" meeting at the Kings River Hotel . She and  Grissom go to this PAF - Con - the Plushies and Furries Convention - looking for a \" plushie \" conventiongoer in bright blue fur to match the sample in the costume \\'s mouth .  Catherine is perplexed at the sight of the furries in the hotel lobby , while the fascinated  Grissom looks at the situation philosophically and psychologically ; the two continue this contrast throughout the episode .  Grissom decides to attend a lecture .   At the convention ,  Grissom takes in the lecture , which centers on concepts of the difference between one \\'s form and one \\'s inner spirit or totem , and , during intermission , asks the person next to him if he recognizes Robert , which  Grissom does n\\'t .  Catherine has similar bad luck with a man in the lobby clutching a stuffed dog . Finally , both gain leads . After  Grissom buys a picture of \" Rocky \" ( Robert Pitt ) with another furry from a photo vendor ,  Grissom finds two girls in blue costumes ; Willows sees a third blue cat walking down a catwalk during a fashion show . Although this cat - \" Sexy \" - shows some initial playful resistance , hissing at  Catherine , all five ( the three furries and the two scientists ) meet in the lobby .   \" Sexy \" is brought in for questioning , and  Grissom reveals  Grissom real name to be Bud Simmons .  Grissom recognizes the scent of civet oil on Bud \\'s cat suit , and tells  Grissom that the costume may have had a part in  Robert \\'s death . Simmons admits that he and \" Rocky \" did partake in \" skritching \" - in this context , quasi - sexual caressing - and his costume is taken in for analysis .  Robert \\'s semen is found on the costume , as well as ipecac and civet oil .   In interrogation ,  Bud reluctantly admits that  Bud actions that night led to a \" furpile \" and some \" yiffing \" - in short , an orgy - but denies that  Bud was the one to apply the ipecac and civet oil to  Bud fursuit . Catherine and  Grissom make their way to a room at the convention where one such \" furpile \" is still going strong , and enter with a search warrant . Investigation of the fursuits of the participants reveals a wolf costume with ipecac and civet oil on its paws .   The suit \\'s owner , Mr. Lee , is brought in for questioning . Through a number of animal metaphors ,  Lee explains  Lee actions , first admitting that  Lee indeed applied the mixture to  Bud \\'s \" Sexy \" costume .  Lee reveals that \"  Rocky \" could n\\'t get enough of \" Sexy \" , and that apparently \"  Rocky \" was a very promiscuous individual , as  Lee believes all raccoons ( or raccoon characters ) to be . In fact ,  Robert stole \" Linda Lamb \" ,  Lee \\'s girlfriend and the woman who brought  Lee into the furry fandom , from  Lee at the previous year \\'s convention .  Lee Lee then reveals the lamb \\'s real name - the collision victim , Linda Jones .  Catherine and Grissom check the trunk of  Linda \\'s wrecked car and indeed see the Linda Lamb costume . They form a new conclusion about  Robert \\'s death - that Linda , tired of Pitt \\'s philandering with other fursuiters , shot  him and left  him for dead .   After mulling over the known facts , they determine that  Robert was on the side of the road because of a lover \\'s quarrel or \" car fight \" - because of the affair , either  Linda kicked  him out or  him insisted on  Linda letting  him out of the car . The fact that  Linda \\'s car was heading back toward the hotel suggests to  Catherine that  Catherine was looking for  Robert again to make up . Although the gunshot wound is still unexplained ,  Catherine finds a valet ticket that might prove valuable .   At the hotel , the valet identifies  Linda and Robert , noting that  Catherine was angry at  Robert and that  Robert was \" hammered . \" Flashbacks reveal the new hypothesis - Robert , still in costume , enters the car , sick from the ipecac .  Linda believes  Robert \\'s gone back on alcohol , and the combination of this and  Robert attendance in the furpile makes  Linda extremely angry . Later on ,  Linda is mad because  Robert is still too delirious or stubborn to remove the mask , and  Robert insists on being let out of the car to vomit . The gunshot still remains unexplained .   Back at the location of  Robert \\'s death ,  Catherine and Grissom find the bullet , which struck from a very steep trajectory . They figure out that  Robert was probably on all fours , and when they see a ranger truck driving along a cliff that would be the perfect location for the trajectory of the bullet , they consider the fact that  Robert was not killed as a man but as an animal .    Catherine and Grissom identify the driver of the ranger truck , who , in recounting  Robert night around the time of  Linda \\'s vehicle collision , states that  Robert saw a \" coyote \" - Robert - at the side of the road and shot it to protect  Robert own dogs .   The episode ends with  Catherine and  Grissom incredulous at the full scope of  Robert \\'s murder . A final flashback recounts the time after  Robert left the car - doubled over in sickness ,  Robert is still throwing up when the ranger sees  Robert and fires .  Linda turns around to pick  Robert up , and hits  Robert as  Robert crawls across the road .  Catherine sums the incident up as a simple \" domestic dispute gone mad , \" while  Grissom calls it \" Fur and Loathing in Las Vegas . \"   Victim : Al Sesto ( deceased )   On the case : Nick Stokes , Sara Sidle , Sam Vega   At the Big & Best warehouse , a man , Al Sesto , is dead and frozen to the freezer floor .  Nick and Sara determine the victim died trying to escape and was hit with a shotgun blast . In the next room ,  Det .  Vega is investigating Petey , the night security guard at Big & Best . Caught in a lie about  Vega whereabouts that night ,  Vega confesses to an extended time away from  Vega post . While  Vega was away ,  Vega was murdered and six vending machines were broken into .  Vega states that  George man named George came by looking for  Vega before  Petey left , and  Vega ate  Vega dinner when  Vega returned .  George \\'s car remains in the parking lot , and  Det .  Vega investigates .   At the warehouse , Doc Robbins helps remove  Vega from the freezer floor by pouring boiling water from around the body .  Nick looks at the blood spatter at the scene and takes a sample of a frozen blood drop and a shotgun pellet , then finds an unidentified black object and collects it . Sara , meanwhile , dusts for prints .   The black object in the Big & Best freezer is identified as a fragment of a shotgun stock . A gray substance on the fragment is identified as adhesive ; the conclusion is that the shotgun owner attempted a very inexpensive repair of the gun \\'s stock . Meanwhile , a man , George Bartell , enters the police department with blood on  his hands , reporting a crime . Upon interrogation ,  his reveals that  his sells expired ice cream for cash , and was going to let  Vega in on the scheme when they found someone smashing the candy machine . The gunman then brought  Vega and  George to the freezer , shot  Vega , knocked out  George and locked  George in the trunk of  George car . When  George came to ,  George twisted a tire iron loose and opened the trunk to escape .  George becomes a suspect , however , when a drop of blood is found on  George pants ;  George is held for further questioning .   Looking over the situation in the warehouse and the single drop of blood on  George \\'s pants ,  Nick and  Sara initiate an experiment , showing that although blood spatter at room temperature will stay largely adherent to the surface it hits . However , spatter in a freezer tends to freeze immediately and bounce off as a number of pellets . They surmise , then , that such a pellet hit  George \\'s pants and , given the angles ,  George could not be the shooter . While pondering the identity of the man behind the murder , they get word that  George \\'s clothing also had a number of paint chips on it , all dual layered - factory - applied burgundy car paint topped with cheap blue house paint . This , combined with the cheap adhesive found on the gun fragment , lower  Nick and  Sara \\'s opinion of the killer .   The adhesive on the gunstock fragment is identified as granite surface adhesive . As there are few granite specialists in the area , this narrows the search for the gunman down considerably .  Virgil man named Virgil is brought in for questioning after being found in connection with both the car and the granite company . Despite the evidence ,  Virgil denies knowing Al Sesto , remains quiet and demands a lawyer .    George and  Virgil see each other in the halls of the police department .  Virgil , forgetting  Virgil ( and proving  Virgil as dimwitted as the CSIs believed ) explicitly admits to the murder by saying  Virgil \" should have shot [  George ] in that freezer . \"  George realizes  George absentmindedness when  George remembers everything  George \\'d innocently told  Virgil , including the vending machines and  Petey \\'s lax attendance on duty .']\n"
